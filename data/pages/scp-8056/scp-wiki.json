A number of vulnerabilities and unexplained aberrations were identified, and S&C Chief Hachiro Kuroki placed the entire facility on alert until further notice.\n\nAs subject was now unconscious, medical and identity tests were conducted by the Health and Pathology Section with assistance from experts in Applied Occultism.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#DEF0FA; padding-left:12px; padding-right:12px; padding-top:6px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ **Medical Report: SCP-8056**\n+++ **Dr. H. Forsythe, CMO, Site-43**\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[f>image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/harry-blank-5/HP.png]]\n\nSubject is a baseline human female approximately 20 years of age. Full spectrum analysis was undertaken per Security and Containment Section directive. The following notable results were derived: \n* Subject is in perfect health;\n* Markers for SCP Foundation health care are present in subject's fluids, organs, and DNA;\n* Environmental indicators suggest long term residence in a 'clean' room or otherwise sequestered facility (cf. medical records of [[[scp-5056 | Technician Philip Deering]]], [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/43-nothing-happens | Nurse Wilhelmina Forsythe]]]);\n* Subject is the biological offspring of Drs. Harold Blank and Melissa Bradbury.\n[[/div]]\n\nDr. Rozálie Astrauskas submitted a report on the subject of SCP-8056's field emanations, more commonly termed her 'aura'.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Dr. Astrauskas is a Class-2 (\"Adept\") Type Blue specializing in auramancy. The only practitioner of this Talent in Foundation employ, her work is therefore only tentative and non-falsifiable; as it was nevertheless responsible for discovering the wholesale replacement of an SCP Foundation facility by malicious doppelgangers in early 2023, however, her assessments carry a high degree of institutional confidence.[[/span]]\n\n[[div class=\"lines\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Auramantic Assessment: \n++ SCP-8056\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n**Prepared by Dr. Rozálie Astrauskas, Site-43**\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/harry-blank-5/Aura_Jennifer.jpg|\n    caption=Somatic representation of subject's field emissions (left) and expert interpretation (right). |\n    align=center|\n    width=700px\n]]\n\n__**Element Key**__\n\n**Standard Bands:**\nVigour Band (blue)\nEmotion Band (red)\nPsychic Band (yellow)\n\n**Standard Elements:**\nHume Spirals (green)\n\n**Esoteric and Novel Inclusions:**\nNone\n\n**Non-Transmissible Inclusions:**\nIdentity Gradient (absent)\nIntent Bloom (absent)\n\n----\n\n**Analysis:** Subject's standard bands read within expected tolerances for a baseline human female, with overlapping flare activity in the emotion and psychic bands indicative of a heightened mood consistent with ongoing anxious trauma. Intent bloom is sporadic and bodily unfocused, suggestive of uncertainty and/or general discombobulation; in a calm and determined state, said bloom should cluster at the ocular orbits and 'shear' in tune with the subject's focus. Hume spirals approximately match the local norm, though mild vertical distortion is observed and clarity is below average, in a state of apparent flux. No esoteric inclusions (thaumic radii/channels, transhumanistic deviations, etc.) are observed, and no uncatalogued elements are present.\n\nThese readings confirm the working theory that subject originates from an alternate iteration of baseline temporality, as opposed to an alternate timeline altogether.\n[[/div]]\n\nAlternate iterations of this kind have been created whenever the Special Containment Procedures for [[[SCP-5243]]] are incorrectly followed. These tangent realities survive until the seven members of Provisional Taskforce Sampi-5243 (\"See You In September\") correctly follow the procedures after one calendar year, at which point temporality collapses back to baseline and the tangent realities cease to exist. The Provisional Taskforce members undergo an involuntary memory realignment twenty-four hours later, forgetting their experiences over the past year and recalling the events of baseline.\n\nDebriefing records for each of these tangents suggest that Tangent 5243-A, wherein an alternate SCP Foundation was created by the senior staff of Site-43 after a catastrophic global conflict, is the most likely origin point for SCP-8056. That this tangent only existed between September 9, 2003 and September 9, 2004 is an obvious complicating factor.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 8056-3, Interview Logs:** After Dr. Ngo's hypodermic sedatives ran their course, subject was placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber for the continuation of the intake process.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Intake Interview:** SCP-8056 (Cont'd)\n**Intake Officer:** Dr. Nhung T.

Dr. Blank is presently 58 years of age, although as a result of advanced Foundation medical treatment his physical age is approximately 48. This places him past the fertility threshold as well. For unknown reasons, potentially as one result of her exposure to SCP-5056 and the resultant trauma, Dr. Bradbury also suffers from primary ovarian insufficiency.\n\nIt is my medical opinion that this partnership is incapable of producing offspring, even with medical intervention, whether said intervention is mundane or paratechnological.\n[[/div]]\n\nIn receipt of the above, the Temporal Anomalies Department nevertheless issued a direct order to all affected parties forbidding the attempted creation of SCP-8056 in baseline temporality.

Never within a year or two from the present moment. \n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/harry-blank-5/8056-Blank.jpg|\n    caption=Dr. Blank. |\n    align=right|    \n    width=250px|\n]]\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** You've had things to do. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Not even that. You ever have that thing... You can't enjoy right now, because you're worried about later? \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** I know what you mean by that. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Right. This is how I spend most interims, thinking about how finite they are. How much time I have left before they end. Having a kid, that puts a timer on so many things. Getting enough sleep. Having privacy. Working on your career. Seeing friends. It locks you in to a whole new kind of life, and locks you out of the one you had before. I've never been ready for that. Never had enough sleep that I'd be willing to start waking up to a screaming baby at every hour. Never had enough time to myself that a few years of being permanently on call started to sound appealing. \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** So you delayed.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I guess. Melissa wasn't in a good place anyway, and I was waiting for her. Not that this is her fault. Or even //a// fault. I just... wasn't ever ready. You know... I used to fantasize about getting to skip the hard work. \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** What do you mean? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Not having to lose sleep or sacrifice my free time or change diapers... Nhung, I have OCD, I will never under any circumstances change a fucking diaper -- but still having a kid. \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Like, hiring a nanny?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** No, just not having to be there for the painful stuff.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Like that Adam Sandler movie. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** That is an unconscionable comparison to make to someone's fantasy. But yes. And no. I imagined, what if some old girlfriend had my baby and never told me? I'd have my legacy, and I wouldn't have had to put in the effort to make sure it took.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** You'd miss a lot. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yeah. First words, first steps, report cards and birthdays and Christmas. Colic and the terrible twos and having to give The Talk. Graduations.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** I meant the processes more than the events. The formative years for the parental bond. They wouldn't even know you. You'd never be like their true parent. People don't form those connections the same way when they're adults. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yeah. And I wouldn't want to tell her I wasn't there for all that because I need at least nine hours of sleep every night.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Does the idea make you feel guilty? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I guess. It's not a very nice thing to wish on a kid, even a fictional one. They'd probably end up hating me.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Now you're on //Star Trek II.//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yeah. Now I am.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Why the movie comparisons all of a sudden? \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Because you're obviously not interested in engaging with this situation in real terms. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** What? \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Jennifer isn't your fantasy of a //fait accompli// daughter you didn't have to raise. She's a real person, and she's suffering from all this ambiguity. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I'm going to see her again. \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Today? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Sure. Today. Why not? \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** You're sure you wouldn't rather go to sleep? Or have some alone time? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** You're very aggressive for a therapist. \n\n**Dr. Ngo:** This isn't therapy. It's counselling. My counsel is to get out there and talk to her while she still wants to talk.\n\n//<Excerpt ends.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 8056-6, Quantum Supermechanics Consult:** During the above interviews, the Quantum Supermechanics Section of Site-43 was engaged in extensive collaboration with the Department of Temporal Anomalies and Dr. Ilse Reynders to determine the feasibility of returning SCP-8056 to her native temporality. The Temporal Anomalies Department rejected all consultation requests.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The DTA's jurisdiction covers local timeline discrepancies, while the TAD is concerned with multiversal timeplane stability.[[/span]] A transcript of the final presentation to Director McInnis is attached below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//<Transcript begins.>//\n\n**Dr. Du:** We can't send her back. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** No? \n\n**Dr. Du:** No. Not even if we knew where she came from, in a useful sense.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** We know where she came from in a useless sense. We know some of the attributes of her reality. But that's like knowing someone comes from a city where the skyscrapers are so many storeys tall, and the civic flag has a stripe in it. Not enough to go on. \n\n**Dr. Du:** At least, not without a database of such things. And if the curt responses I've been getting to my enquiries are anything to go by, TAD either hasn't got one of those or doesn't want me seeing it. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** But you're saying it wouldn't matter anyway. \n\n**Dr. Du:** Right. Because we aren't talking about an alternate timeline or an alternate Earth. We're talking about another version of //this// Earth. One that doesn't even exist anymore. Probably.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Probably.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** It's like how you can't send your consciousness into the version of you who existed last year. You don't share many cells with that guy. You aren't cell mates, if you'll excuse the pun. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** With reluctance. \n\n**Dr. Reynders:** It's an instructive pun. You can't reach out and touch that other you, because they aren't really other at all. They're just you, on a tangent. Like your subconscious plugging away on a problem while your conscious mind has the reins. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** How far does that metaphor go? Are these time-tangents still extant, only submerged? Or are they truly dead, as Dr. Du seems to be saying? \n\n**Dr. Du:** I suspect that [EXPUNGED] has progressed to the point where the nature of reality is so fungible that past possible states are occasionally asserting themselves, piecemeal. Reality's pores are opening, we're seeing what lies beneath, and then it scabs over. I can't imagine that seven different versions of this universe still exist simultaneously.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Containment of SCP-5243 has failed six times, producing six one-year tangent timelines.[[/span]] That would be outrageously unstable. \n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Although that might explain [EXPUNGED]. Could even be the root cause. \n\n**Dr. Du:** For our present purposes, though, that doesn't matter. What matters is that there's only one known way to pass between these tangents and baseline, and that's SCP-5243. \n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Specifically, messing up its conprocs.\n\n**Dr. Du:** And that only works for Sampi-5243, and even then only for a year. \n\n**Dr. Reynders:** TAD agents have jumpwatches. We don't know how they work, and they're not telling. But we do have anecdotal evidence which suggests they can only hop between discrete timelines. Whatever membrane separates these tangents, it isn't permeable in that manner. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Meaning, to paraphrase what you already said, our guest can never go home. \n\n**Dr. Du:** That's right. \n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Yes. Unfortunately.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Quite.\n\n**Dr. Du:** Why unfortunately? \n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Because it might worsen [EXPUNGED] to have a rogue variable from an outside context in baseline. If there's one thing nature abhors more than a vacuum, it's a thing out of place. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** And nature's abhorrence pales beside that of the Overseers.\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 8056-7:** On 27 May 2024, the Department of Temporal Anomalies recused itself from further consultation on the matter of SCP-8056. Its final report is appended below.\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 2px #7E7E9A; background:#fff url('https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/harry-blank-5/DTA.png') center no-repeat; padding-left:15px; padding-right: 15px; margin: 10px auto; width: 80%\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Department of Temporal Anomalies\n+++ Report: SCP-8056\n[[/=]]\n----\nOn 10/31/2022, Drs. Polyxeni Mataxas and Mali Wattana of the Spectrometry and Spectremetry Section of Site-43 encountered [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/graveyard-shift | a temporal anomaly]]] in The Ward Cemetery near Grand Bend, Ontario, Canada. Both researchers rapidly transitioned through multiple anomalous spaces geographically congruent with the cemetery but wildly variable in contents, makeup, and survivability. Subsequent analysis has determined that six of these variants can be mapped with a high degree of confidence to the six known tangent realities created by SCP-5243. Said tangents are only known to have existed for a single calendar year in each case, corresponding to the years in which the containment procedures for SCP-5243 were enacted incorrectly. Nevertheless, the researchers would appear from contextual clues to have visited each tangent during a period of time in which each tangent was not known to have existed, ranging from the near to the far future. Tangent 5243-A, code named \"Playing Gods,\" was visited at some point in the late 2050s. The researchers briefly encountered a woman in early middle age, who was in the process of visiting the shared grave of Dr. Harold Blank and Dr. Melissa Bradbury.\n\nBoth researchers were amnesticized after being debriefed about their experience, as it was quickly determined to have been one facet of the ongoing [EXPUNGED] which constitutes the primary research and containment initiative of Site-43 at this time, classified at the highest level. Nevertheless, the description they were able to give is fully consistent with the physical appearance of SCP-8056, when accounting for two decades' worth of aging.\n\nThis would appear to be empirical confirmation that SCP-8056 originates in Tangent 5243-A, and also further confirmation that elements of these otherwise dead alternate realities may assert themselves in baseline temporality as a result of [EXPUNGED]. Reports that random, unexplained variables are interfering with security operations at Site-43 may also represent ontokinetic bleed related to [EXPUNGED].\n\nIt is my recommendation that extensive research into the origins and nature of SCP-8056 be conducted by the researchers presently managing her file, so that we might better understand this crisis as it unfolds. As the present anomaly is of multiversal origin, however, I am forced to concede that my department's jurisdiction is superseded by that of the Temporal Anomalies Department. This report will therefore be my final statement on the matter, unless Director Xyank (or whoever is fulfilling his duties in his presumed absence) sees fit to consult me further. \n\n[[>]]\n-- Alice Forth, Director, Department of Temporal Anomalies\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 8056-8, Replication Studies Consult:** Extensive interdisciplinary collaboration was attempted to further understand the nature of SCP-8056.

Yeah. \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** You and I have something in common. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Besides the name, you mean. \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** We both know what it's like to wake up in a world we don't recognize, where we don't really belong. You've had that happen a few times. But you didn't have to stay there. I did. And your daughter, it looks like she will too.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I see the parallel.\n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** One minute, I'm falling down a well. Next minute, I'm crawling back out. Minute after that, I'm at ground level again. That's my perspective. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, though, somewhere in between those minutes half a century got lost.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Is that why you left Sloth's Pit?\n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** Trying to get ahead of me? In my own trauma narrative? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Sorry. It's just... I guess I'm getting impatient about all these illustrative stories people want to tell me. I'm sick of my //own// stories, even. Not a very good historian right now. Go on. \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** Well, you hit it on the head anyway. I did leave the Pit, eventually, because of what came next. And I wish I could tell you I regret it, but I don't. Because I learned something about myself, and my situation, by doing that. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Okay. \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** It sucks when nobody knows who you are. It sucks when you're completely alone. It feels like you have no backup when you're down, like nobody will be there to catch you when you fall. It feels that way no matter where you are. But it's so much worse in familiar surroundings. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Why? \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** Because being a stranger in a strange land makes sense. There's a fitness to it. Being a stranger in your home, though? That's a little like going mad.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Have you ever known anyone with dementia? \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** No...\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I have. When it's someone you care about, it's like... the familiar becoming unfamiliar. Not just for them, but for you. It seems like the person you know, but they're saying things, doing things, that you know the person you know would never say or do. And that feels like... I dunno. Like falling down a well. Like losing your home. Like your home not recognizing you. \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** I don't want to diminish that, but I think this situation is even... Not worse, obviously I wouldn't say worse, but harder to wrap your mind around. People getting sick and forgetting you? That's terrible. People treating you like a stranger, like you don't belong, when you know you do? That's...\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Gaslighting. \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** Only it's the universe gaslighting you. Gaslighting //everybody.// Those people are right to believe what they believe. And so are you, even though there's no way the two things should be true at the same time. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** It sucks. \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** It does.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Would you say you've, if not gotten over it, found a way to handle it? Live with it? \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** Yeah, I think I have. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** How? \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** The problem was a break in the narrative. The narrative of my life. So I started a new one. The people that I knew were gone. So I found new people. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** What if the old people had still been around? Would you have wanted to rebuild what you had? \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** I have no idea if I would have wanted that. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Okay. \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** But you know what I did want, more than anything? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** What? \n\n**Dr. LeBlanc:** To be able to make that decision. To decide for myself if I wanted to try.\n\n//<Transcript ends.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 8056-9, Decommissioning Proposal:** Though still rejecting requests for consultation, the Temporal Anomalies Department had apparently opened a file of its own on SCP-8056.

It is unattested in any governmental database, and its attestation would be a costly and dangerous venture with no clear benefit. Its discovery by parties beyond the Foundation risks the integrity of the Veil of Normalcy. Its person represents an obvious error in the sorting algorithm of baseline temporality, a loophole which must be closed. Maintaining the illusion that this subject belongs in baseline temporality is tantamount to gaslighting, an abuse forbidden by Ethics Committee guidelines without special dispensation. Its presence may be interpreted as a violation of the ban on cross-timeline trade outlined in the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5618 | Multi-Foundation Pact of 1981]]], endangering your local Foundation's membership in the Multi-Foundation Coalition itself. Its presence is a known violation of Temporal Anomalies Department Guidelines. If its continued existence is allowed, the fabric of space time may be subject to unknown stresses potentially leading to any manner of catastrophic K-class events. At the very least, the ongoing security snafu at Site-43 is almost certainly linked to this subject's presence. It must be decommissioned posthaste.\n> \n> //-- Assistant Director A.

(LV-Class Lifted Veil Scenario is not only not K-class, by the way, it's already covered by the first checkbox.) The alarmism on display here is, frankly, alarming; I have been over Dr. Ngo's research files (the decision to imply that SCP-8056 has no Head Researcher is particularly petty and misleading) and find nothing there to support a single one of the above claims.\n\nAs the Temporal Anomalies Department is unable to provide me with concrete evidence backing their rationale for this course of action -- and as my correspondence with Chief Kuroki of Site-43's security force leads me to believe there is no correlation between SCP-8056 and the \"security snafu\" alluded to here -- I am unable to provide them with an endorsement for said course. \n\nSince I am also unable to achieve contact with Director Xyank, the matter has been forwarded to the Overseer Council for mediation.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Dir.

And they were the worst years of my life, actually. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** That's what I mean. They shouldn't have been. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** We're making up for it now.\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Are we? That girl--\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Woman.\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** That //woman,// her parents changed their world. They made it better, for her. They achieved so much, under //so much// pressure. What have I achieved?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** You clawed your way back to normal from a long way down. You kicked ass.\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** I cried myself to sleep so many times, I lost the capacity for tears. I telecommuted until my legs almost atrophied. You were saving the world, but when I finally saw you again? You'd had a week's worth of personal development that took you hundreds of times too long. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Hey.\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Most people don't wait until middle age to knock on their crush's door. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** There were mitigating circumstances, if you'll recall. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Not that mitigating. We waited twenty years, Harry.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Not quite twenty. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Longer, actually. A quarter century. We should have been together when the new millennium struck. For us, it didn't mean anything. A new millennium, and it didn't mean //anything.//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** They never mean anything. Nothing more than we pretend they mean. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** We had more than twenty years to make that human being exist, Harry. And we didn't. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Okay.\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** And you've met her. You've talked to her. You killed her, do you understand? I killed her too. We killed our daughter.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Don't go getting pro-life on me. \n\n//<Dr. Bradbury laughs.>//\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** I hate how you do that. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Do what? \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Trivialize things to defuse them. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** It was already trivial, Mel. We didn't kill her. That woman I've been talking to? She isn't our daughter. She's //theirs.// And they lived very different lives. They're different people. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** The potential for her existed in this universe. In us. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** So what?\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** So what? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yeah! Do you think we have some moral responsibility to reproduce, literally reproduce every potential person we're aware of in the multiverse? \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** No, but--\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Because we know now that we could have had a child, it's morally wrong that we didn't then? \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** No...\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Then what? What is this argument? What's so terrible about the road we took? Just that it didn't lead to her? \n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Melissa, it wasn't your fault. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** I know. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Your body didn't do this. Neither did mine. We can regret our choices, but we can't blame ourselves for them. For wanting what we wanted. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** I know! \n\n**Dr. Blank:** And the other versions of us had so much more reason to bring a child into the world. They were never separated. That Melissa was never attacked. Their world was depopulated. They were together, //and// they had a moral imperative. We were apart, and we prioritized other things. We had that luxury, even though it didn't feel like one.\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** I know all of this, Harry. //I// know it. But this isn't about me. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** No?\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** No. Sort of. No. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I don't understand. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** What do you think she sees when she looks at you? What would she see when she looks at me? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Her parents? \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** No. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** What, then?\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Two people who had the chance to //become// her parents -- two people who had the opportunity to bring her into existence -- and decided they had better things to do. \n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** We aren't looking at a road less travelled. We're looking at the loser of a contest for our attention. And she knows that's what she is. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** She... knows she could easily have never existed in her world, either. Knows she was never inevitable. Was never better than unlikely. She knows there's a point at which she could have been wanted so little, she would never have been born. In a way more precise than any of us could ever know.\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** That's right. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Well. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Yeah. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** It seems to me there's an obvious way to address this problem. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Do tell. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Show her she's wanted now. \n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** You know what I think? \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Something stupid, probably. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I think you're just mad I impregnated another woman. \n\n//<Dr. Bradbury laughs, and shoves Dr. Blank.>//\n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** Fuck off!

And where is Director Xyank?\n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** I'm not here to exposit for you.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** You don't know, do you? You don't know.\n\n**O5-8:** Allan.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** I have had rather enough cryptic oversight from this unaccountable, unappointed watchdog agency, sir. \n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** You //are// talking mutiny, then.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** I would use the term //insubordination,// if necessary.\n\n**O5-8:** Stop this, both of you. What basis do you have for declaring this anomaly vital, Allan? Under your jurisdiction?\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** The circumstances of her appearance are linked, beyond all reasonable doubt, with SCP-5243 and [EXPUNGED]. We do not fully understand her -- why she is here, what her appearance represents, how entwined she might be with baseline temporality now, despite her origins. It would be irresponsible, potentially catastrophic to remove her from the equation before these things are understood. I cannot condone her decommissioning under the present circumstances.\n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** We don't need your permission to remove this threat. We've sent agents into your facility before, and your permission was just a formality. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** You're claiming your multiversal prerogative here? \n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** Yes. The safety of the timestream is paramount, trumping any strictly local concerns -- which, by the way, is how you yourself have characterized this. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Very well. If a multiversal response is what you seek, then you shall have it. \n\n//<Dir. McInnis thumbs his intercom button.>//\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Send them in. \n\n//<The double doors open. The All-Sections Chief, Dr. Harold Blank, Dr. Karen Elstrom, Dr. Trevor Bremmel, Dr. Melissa Bradbury, Dr. Eileen Veiksaar, Chief Delfina Ibanez, Dr. Lillian Lillihammer, Dr. Ilse Reynders, Dr. Udo Okorie, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6382 | Thilo Zwist]]], Dr. Nhung Ngo, Dr. Daniil Sokolsky and Dr. William Wettle enter the room. They find their seats.>//\n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** What's this? Your Chairs and Chiefs?\n\n**O5-8:** And an outsider.\n\n**Zwist:** Hello.\n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** I thought you'd understand and respect the hierarchy a little better, //Allan.//\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** I don't believe you're qualified to call me that.\n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** What? \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** We are determining the fate of a citizen from another world. The identity of that world has been conclusively proven. And I am not its Director of Site-43.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I am. Apparently?\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Unless things have changed very much in the intervening years, my title there was Administrator.\n\n//<Dir. McInnis gestures at the assembled personnel.>//\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** And these, according to our debriefing record, were the Architects of the A5 Council. They who laid the Cornerstone. Chief Nascimbeni and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5866 | Dr. Corbin]]] regrettably cannot be with us, and there may have been roster changes on the other side to which we naturally are not privy, but I suspect this gathering still constitutes a quorum. And I assure you we are quite united on the subject of SCP-8056. Aye?\n\n**\"Architects\" (together):** Aye.\n\n**Dr. Sokolsky:** I was apparently the contrarian of the group, but I'm honestly not feeling it right now.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** You're //not// executing a member of my staff. Sir. Sirs? Sir and ma'am.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** And certainly not in my facility. \n\n**Dr. Bradbury:** And not my //fucking daughter.//\n\n//<Dr. Blank reaches across the table to take her hand.>//\n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** This is preposterous. The reality you're all... //roleplaying// about no longer even exists. It was only a blip. \n\n**Dr. Bremmel:** Not even a true reality, if what Du tells me is true. And don't tell him I said this, but his data's not wrong. That tangent is really just our world, rearranged. \n\n**Dir. McInnis:** So only a blip, and a local one at that. Not a multiversal matter at all. And if it is, you are almost certainly acting in contravention of the wishes of its highest authority. Tantamount to circumventing the Overseer Council. Is that your policy, Assistant Director? \n\n**Assistant Director Konjit:** I...\n\n**O5-8:** Know when you're beaten.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Thank you. \n\n**O5-8:** You'll know it yourself, Allan, soon enough. This display was just short of farce.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Given the stakes, sir... better farce than tragedy. Wouldn't you agree?\n\n//<Transcript ends.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 8056-14, Containment Breach:** On 06/14/2024, a series of explosions triggered automatic lockdown protocols across the main facility of Site-43. It was later determined that an unknown Group of Interest had planted incendiary devices in the bedrock surrounding the Site's protective sheathing and second skin; Security and Containment Chief Hachiro Kuroki reported that the attacks mostly closely resembled an attempt to gauge structural weaknesses and surveillance blind spots. He also expressed the view that the ongoing security difficulties first discovered when SCP-8056 manifested were in actual fact preparatory action by the unknown aggressors, and entirely unrelated to her presence or [EXPUNGED]. This thesis has been widely accepted by the Site's systems, security, and scientific experts.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/harry-blank-5/Bomb.jpg|\n    caption=Unidentified sigil. |\n    width=300px\n]]\n\nThe bulk of the incendiary devices were completely destroyed, but some fragments of material were recovered bearing a badly burned and obscured sigil which to date has not been positively identified. The Groups of Interest Research Group has been engaged on the matter, and their report remains pending.\n\nAt the outset of the lockdown, Dr. Blank immediately proceeded from his office at Archives and Revision, through the Habitation and Sustenance Section, to Dr. Bradbury's office in Research and Experimentation. These actions are consistent with his behaviour in previous containment breaches, and represent a pattern of behaviour for which he has been reprimanded by Security and Containment staff. Upon assuring himself of Dr. Bradbury's safety, Dr. Blank attempted to return to the corridor, but was directed to remain with Dr. Bradbury by S&C personnel. Both doctors protested, but were compelled to respect the lockdown until it was lifted three hours later. \n\n----\n**Addendum 8056-15, Aftermath:** Subsequent to the above event, when the lockdown was fully lifted, Drs. Blank and Bradbury attempted to ascertain the location of SCP-8056. She was found to be occupying her dormitory, with the door locked. She declined to allow either doctor entry.\n\nDr. Blank and SCP-8056 met the following day, in the Archives and Revision Section main offices.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//<Transcript begins.>//\n\n//<SCP-8056 is standing near Dr. Blank's desk. He moves to stand in front of her. Neither moves to take a seat.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** You asked to be transferred. \n\n**SCP-8056:** I asked //about// being transferred. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I'm sorry, Jennifer. Old habits...\n\n**SCP-8056:** Did I even cross your mind? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Of course. \n\n**SCP-8056:** That's worse. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I've known your mother for decades. I've known you for a couple of weeks. \n\n**SCP-8056:** I thought I'd known you my whole life, but I don't know you at all any more. \n\n//<Dr. Blank walks around the desk, and sits down heavily in his chair. SCP-8056 remains standing.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I lost her in a containment breach. Lost her in a few of them, actually. Got her back in one, too. We've been through a lot together, and a lot more apart. We built something. Building something takes time, and when you have it, you want to protect it. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Were you protecting her from me? Or was it her idea to stay away so long? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** We're all raw about this, Jennifer. There's no way around it. \n\n//<Dr. Blank sighs.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** When you're young, you only see one road. When you're our age, you can make out the others in the distance. Your eyes get worse and your brain gets fuzzier, but you get more philosophical. You can see where you might have ended up, if you'd taken a different turn. And it sucks. Because nobody ever walks the optimal path. \n\n**SCP-8056:** My parents -- my real parents -- didn't either. It took a global genocide to detour them so bad their paths finally converged. Probably nothing less dramatic could have done it. I'm... contingent.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Everybody is contingent. And every thing. \n\n//<SCP-8056 pulls a chair from the nearest cubicle, and sits down. She fidgets, and looks down at her hands.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** You're wrong about age and the other roads. I can see them too. And I can see that only one of them leads to //me.// Statistically, by the numbers, I don't exist.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Historian's fallacy. \n\n//<SCP-8056 looks up.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** What? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Something happening a certain way doesn't mean it //had// to happen that way. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Tell that to the TAD.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** We already did. \n\n**SCP-8056:** What's that supposed to mean? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I... can't tell you. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Great. So it's just your word that you guys give a shit, against all the evidence to the contrary. What fallacy is that? Ignoring the evidence to believe what you want to? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** That's not a fallacy. That's just bad science. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Exactly. Try this on for good science: I think I understand why the memories I have still don't properly fit with the way this timeline played out. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Go on.\n\n**SCP-8056:** There's nothing that could have changed here that would have allowed me to be born. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** But you //were// born.\n\n**SCP-8056:** Not here. This is a world completely hostile to the concept of my birth.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** But //you exist anyway.// You're your own proof.\n\n**SCP-8056:** Proof that I'm a fluke. And if you don't want me, maybe they didn't either. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** We never said we don't want you. \n\n**SCP-8056:** You didn't have to. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** We do. Want you. \n\n**SCP-8056:** That's not what I've seen. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** In how long? \n\n**SCP-8056:** What? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** How long have you had to see? How long have we had to show you? We haven't even had time to come to grips with the fact that you exist. That you //could// exist. \n\n**SCP-8056:** People have been having babies for a long time. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Not individually they haven't. It's the first time, every time, for everybody. It's always a dramatic detour from the beaten path. And this one was a whole lot twistier than usual.\n\n//<Silence on recording. SCP-8056 looks away.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** You need to give us a chance.\n\n**SCP-8056:** So I can get a bad imitation of a thing I already had, at best.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** So you can see that your parents would always have loved you, no matter the circumstances. \n\n//<SCP-8056 looks out the bank of windows on the southern wall, in the direction of the approach to Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** If my parents sent me here -- which sounds more and more like feel-good bullshit, by the way, and I notice that none of the super scientists are giving that theory the time of day -- if my parents //loved// me and they sent me //here,// then they made a mistake. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** No. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Because it means they thought you'd take care of me the way they would. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Jennifer...\n\n**SCP-8056:** They thought you were the same, but you're not. \n\n//<SCP-8056 turns to look at Dr. Blank again.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** You aren't my father.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I am, actually. In a profoundly literal sense.\n\n**SCP-8056:** Not in all the ways that matter. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** It was my consciousness in 2004. The year you were conceived. I was inhabiting that version of myself. That's how 5243 works, how the alternate timelines work. I'm your father. \n\n**SCP-8056:** //Not in all the ways that matter.//\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I tried to stay with you. Well, I tried to stay with your mother. In the tangent. I tried.\n\n**SCP-8056:** Did you? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I did. That was the first deadline.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Internal PTF Sampi-5243 terminology for the SCP-5243 tangents.[[/span]] We had no idea the Breach was going to come again, that we were going to get the chance to go back to baseline, but it's not like we weren't prepared for the possibility. We were very prepared. But I didn't want to go. \n\n**SCP-8056:** I mean... That's kind of awful, isn't it? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Go on. \n\n**SCP-8056:** All those dead people...\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yeah. \n\n**SCP-8056:** You must have really loved her a lot. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Always. \n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Although...\n\n**SCP-8056:** What? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** It's not like I remember it. It was taken from me. Like it was taken from you. All I have is my own debriefing record. \n\n**SCP-8056:** I don't even have that.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** You have something. You know you loved your parents enough to go half mad with fear when you didn't know if they were okay.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** I wonder if those versions of you guys ever fought. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** It's like you said. Nothing fixes everything. No family is perfect. But whether or not we can prove it... I don't think it hurts to imagine that you're here because of how much your parents loved you. That maybe, just maybe, they loved you all the way into //existence.// Twice.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** Still. I wonder. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** It cost us a lot, coming back home. Every single time. \n\n//<Dr. Blank sighs.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Well. Maybe not every single time. But most of them. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Was I born in any of those other tangents? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** No. We talked about this.\n\n**SCP-8056:** So you never actually gave me up, when the time came around. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** How could I have ever done that? \n\n**SCP-8056:** You don't think you could have?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** No.\n\n**SCP-8056:** Not even to save the world?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** No. I don't know.\n\n**SCP-8056:** Then how can you suggest that //they// did it?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Because this is different. Because this gave you //life.// Parents would do anything for their children. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Or so you've heard. Not really a thing you've experienced firsthand. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** No. It isn't. But I'd like to. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Now that it's easy. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yes. \n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Did you expect me to deny that? \n\n**SCP-8056:** I kinda did. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I'm not going to lie to you about who I am now. But I'm always in the process of becoming someone else. All of us are. It doesn't take a temporal anomaly to change the course of your personal history. Sometimes it's as simple as finding something you never knew you lost.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I might not be your father, but I do want to be. Doing the job is nine tenths of having it. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Well, you showed up late for work. Very late. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** So, demote me. But don't fire me. Or your mother. \n\n**SCP-8056:** It's going to be a long time before I can think of either of you that way. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** We have a long time. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Do you? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** We spend most of every day trying to make sure that's the case. I don't intend to stop now. And you can help.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** I wonder if it would have seemed like a fair trade.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** What do you mean?\n\n**SCP-8056:** I don't remember them. I'm never going to see them again. I'm here, and they're gone. Forever. Would that have seemed...\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yes.\n\n**SCP-8056:** It was a rhetorical question.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** The answer is still yes. Being a parent means... being willing to make sacrifices. \n\n**SCP-8056:** How would you know? \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Because I wasn't willing. Not until now.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n//<SCP-8056 stands, smoothing out her clothes. She averts her eyes, and hugs herself.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** I'm changing my name. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yeah? \n\n**SCP-8056:** My last name. I don't want people thinking I'm your daughter. I don't want to answer their questions. \n\n//<Dr. Blank looks down at his desk.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I suppose that's fair. \n\n**SCP-8056:** I'm going to try and get recertified for Foundation work.\n\n//<Dr. Blank looks up again.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I can help--\n\n**SCP-8056:** On my own merits. \n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** I mean. You already did help. The first time around. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** I guess. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Maybe there's an entry level job at Site-12.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** You should stay here. \n\n**SCP-8056:** Dad...\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**SCP-8056:** I don't even know what to call you. \n\n//<Dr. Blank stands.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Stay here.\n\n**SCP-8056:** It'll be weird. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** So what? \n\n**SCP-8056:** We have nothing in common. \n\n**Dr. Blank:** That's not true. \n\n//<Dr. Blank smiles.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** We might not share a history, but we can still //share history.// And... every day forward, is the same day for both of us.\n\n//<Transcript ends.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n**Addendum 8056-16, Present Status:** SCP-8056, under the alias Jennifer Vide, is at present a junior researcher in Archives and Revision under the supervision of Dr. Harold Blank.\n\nThe Temporal Anomalies Department has lodged a formal protest re: the above with the Overseer Council.
