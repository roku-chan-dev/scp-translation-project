It is to be physically disconnected from any power source when not in active use. All explorations must be approved by the Director of the Department of Astronomy, pending a full evaluation on the target exoplanet's[[footnote]]A planet outside of the solar system[[/footnote]] surface conditions.\n\nSCP-8390 is only to be operated by personnel with advanced astronaut training. During testing, the participating subject is to be provided with a reinforced EVA[[footnote]]Extra-Vehicular Activity[[/footnote]] space suit with built in audio and video recording devices and be supervised by at least two Security Clearance Level 4 (Secret) researchers. The designated power source for SCP-8390 must be equiped with an emergency kill switch capable of disabling SCP-8390 within a moments notice. One of the two supervising researchers must remain in constant communication with the subject with the other stationed at the kill switch. At the conclusions of exploration, SCP-8390 is to be deactivated and the subject decontaminated before debriefing.\n\n**Update 24/3/2024:** Following Incident-8390-1, under no circumstances is SCP-8390 to be used on any exoplanet known/suspected to harvest esoteric life of any kind. All subjects returning from exploratory missions must now be quarantined for at least fourteen (14) days before release.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8390 is a 7 inch telescope measuring over 1.3m in length. Its style and build is almost identical to that of the Wetherell Refractor Telescope, but has undergone heavy internal modifications of a highly anomalous nature. The primary lens has been removed and the inside of the normal empty optical tube now contains what appears to be a Thaumaturgicaly Enhanced Quantum Accelerator (hereafter referred to as SCP-8390-1), a device capable of teleporting light-quanta across vast distances for FTL transmission[[footnote]]A lesser version of this technology is used in several Foundation operated satellites used for monitoring extra planetary anomalies such as SCP-179 and SCP-2399.[[/footnote]]. Testing has confirmed SCP-8390-1 to be the source of SCP-8390's anomalous properties.\n\nUpon activation, SCP-8390 is capable of perfectly focusing on astronomical objects from hundreds of lightyears away, creating images of such quality it is possible to see geographical features of terrestrial exoplanets with the human eye. Experiments have confirmed FTL transmission on said images. However, SCP-8390-1 appears to absorb energy the longer it is in use, \"charging\" itself up. After 30 minutes of consecutive charging, SCP-8390-1 reaches 10 PeV[[footnote]]Peta Electron Volts. Equivalent to 10^^15^^ eV. Note this is in terms of energy //per particle// rather than the entire device.[[/footnote]], at which point it becomes capable of temporarily transmitting physical matter. At this point, if SCP-8390 is observing a terrestrial exoplanet/astronomical body, the person operating it will disappear from their current location, only remanifesting when SCP-8390 is powered down. According to testimony and review of body cam video, the subject is actually physically teleported to the targeted planet, where they are subject to the effects of the local environment in its entirety. This typically results in the subject's death unless properly protected from such conditions.\n\nThe subject can freely explore the surface of the planet, interacting with the terrain and other objects as expected. However, it is impossible to bring anything from said planet back to Earth, as it is not transported with the subject upon return. This is also true for attempting to leave any object behind on the planet, as it is returned with the subject, regardless of whether or not said object is in contact with the subject. --Due to these properties, there is believed to be little to no risk of biological contamination of Earth, nor the target planet. Nevertheless, decontamination protocols have been instated as a precaution.-- See Addendum 3.\n\n\n**Addendum 1: Discovery and Interview Log:**\n\nSCP-8390 was discovered on 6 November 2023 following an undercover investigation on a missing person report for civilian astronomer Professor Mathew Coleman, who according to his wife Mrs Amanda Coleman had spontaneously disappeared while using his new telescope. Agents of MTF Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\") were dispatched to the relevant household to evaluate and contain the cause of the event. They quickly noticed SCP-8390 due to its modifications and, upon deactivating it, the corpse of Professor Coleman suddenly manifested nearby[[footnote]]Cause of death was later identified as asphyxiation.[[/footnote]]. Epsilon-6 quickly secured the item and dispatched Agent ███████ to interview Mrs Coleman.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 7/11/23\n\n**Interviewed:** Amanda Coleman\n\n**Interviewer:** Agent ███████\n\n**Foreword:** The following interview was conducted at the police station in an attempt to determine the nature and/or origin of SCP-8390. The Interviewee was not informed of the discovery of their spouse's body.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//<Agent ███████ enters the secure interview room. Interviewee is seated next to a table in a state of clear distress.>//\n\n**Agent ███████:** Mrs Coleman?\n\n//<Interviewee raises her head and looks towards Agent ███████ speaking in a frantic and  erratic manner.>//\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** Finally! Do you have anything on Matt yet? They won't tell me anything! Did something happen?!\n\n**Agent ███████:** Ma'am, please calm down. I assure you we are doing everything we can to find your husband.\n\n//<Interviewee takes several seconds to breathe.>//\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** I'm sorry, I... I just...\n\n**Agent ███████:** It's alright, you're under a lot of stress. If it's ok with you I'd like to ask a few things about your husband.\n\n//<Interviewee motions to the chair nearby. Agent ███████ sits down.>//\n\n**Agent ███████:** Based on what we've seen, your husband seems to be an expert amateur astronomer. Is this true?\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** Oh he loves space. He's always found it so mysterious, so vast. I never paid much attention or thought to it though. At least until he... *Sighs* He said that he had found something, a few months ago.\n\n**Agent ███████:** Go on.\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** He was convinced he had found... life... on another planet, Trappist-1E he called it. I know it sounds ridiculous but... well, he wrote a paper on it and had it published. Of course, no-one believed him.\n\n**Agent ███████:** Interesting. So the scientists rejected his claims?\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** Yes, but that didn't stop him. He spent weeks, maybe a month trying to refine it, to prove he was right. He'd be up all night gazing into the sky. I wouldn't see him for days at a time. He became a bit of a celebrity online, if you can call it that; all they did was ridicule him.\n\n**Agent ███████:** I see. Did you notice anything unusual about him just before he disappeared?\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** Well a few times this last week, I did see him speaking to a group of these... men. I don't know who they were, I'd just assumed they were some scientists or someone he'd caught the interest of. They seemed to be making some kind of deal with him.\n\n**Agent ███████:** A deal?\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** They said they would help him if he promised to share his data with them before he released it publicly. He agreed and they left for a few days. That's when they brought in that... device...\n\n**Agent ███████:** When you say \"device\" are you talking about the telescope he was using?\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** Yes- well, no but- kind of?\n\n**Agent ███████:** Please elaborate.\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** He's always had the telescope, but they brought in this huge tube of wires and all this other stuff. It looked like something from out of a sci-fi movie. I have no idea what it was but Matt was jamming it into the front of the telescope.\n\n**Agent ███████:** And what about the men? Did they have any identifying markers?\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** I never saw their faces, but they all had this weird symbol on their shoulders.\n\n**Agent ███████:** Could you describe it for me?\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** Do you have a pen?\n\n//<Agent ███████ passes over a sheet of paper and a pen. Interviewee quickly draws a picture of a circle with 3 parallel arrows through it before passing it back. Agent ███████ examines it for several moments before folding it up and placing it in his pocket.>//\n\n**Agent ███████:** Thank you, one more thing. When did you see him last?\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** He was on the balcony, testing the telescope after its... reconstruction. He was playing with the focus and everything for maybe half an hour when he called out to tell me to take a look at something. I went over to the balcony but when I got there he was... gone. Just gone.\n\n//<Interviewee holds her head in her hands and begins quietly weeping.>//\n\n**Agent ███████:** Thank you Mrs Coleman, my colleagues will be with you shortly.\n\n//<Agent ███████ stands up and heads for the door.>//\n\n**Amanda Coleman:** Please find him...\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** Mrs Coleman was administered Class-A amnestics and released. The provided sketch was identified as the emblem of GOI-003 (\"The Chaos Insurgency\"). It is believed that they were unaware of the effects of SCP-8390-1 after long periods of use. A cover story was distributed to local news networks attributing Professor Coleman's death to an automobile accident. SCP-8390 was taken into Foundation custody along with several documents regarding the alleged discovery. Verification of Prof. Coleman's discovery is pending at time of writing.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 2: Experiment Log:**\n\nWith approval from the Department of Astronomy, several tests were carried out to establish the specifics of SCP-8390's functionality and limitations. The following is an abridged list of said experiments. Several proposals to utilise SCP-8390 in containment of extraterrestrial anomalies are --pending review-- suspended until further notice following Incident-8390-1.\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Experiment-8390-1**\n\n||||||||||||~ Target Body Name: GJ 1061 D ||\n||~ Type||~ Distance||~ Mass ||~ Radius ||~ Gravity||~ Temperature ||\n||= Super Earth ||= 12ly||= 1.64M🜨 ||= 1.16 R🜨 ||= 1.21G ||= 250°K (-23°C) ||\n\n**Intent:** Initial testing to confirm anomalous properties.\n\n**Participating Subject:** D-9564\n\n**Procedure:** SCP-8390 was aligned with the target and activated by D-9564 who was instructed to observe the target for 1 hour.\n\n**Observations:** Subject reported SCP-8390 was providing a seemingly impossible level of detail, to the point they were allegedly able to view geographical features on the surface of the target. Over the course of 30 minutes SCP-8390-1 continued to gain energy until D-9564 suddenly vanished. SCP-8390 was quickly deactivated at which point the subject re-manifested at their original position, albeit unconscious. D-9564 was treated for asphyxiation and made a full recovery. Subject vividly remembered surroundings as being similar to the observed region.\n\n**Notes:** //Well, that explains Prof. Coleman's death. We should prepare for the conditions next time.// - Dr. Andrews\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Experiment-8390-2**\n\n||||||||||||~ Target Body Name: Teegarden's Star C ||\n||~ Type ||~ Distance ||~ Mass ||~ Radius ||~ Gravity||~ Temperature ||\n||= Terrestrial ||= 12ly ||= 1.05M🜨 ||= 1.02R🜨 ||= 1G ||= 226°K (-47°C) ||\n\n**Intent:** Determine if safe travel can be accomplished via a space suit.\n\n**Participating Subject:** D-3293\n\n**Procedure:** D-3292 was equipped with a reinforced EVA space suit and instructed to use SCP-8390 until teleportation occurred.\n\n**Observations:** D-3292 vanished as expected at the 30 minute mark but was still able to communicate in real time with supervising researchers via inbuilt radio transmitter. After 60 seconds SCP-8390 was deactivated and D-3292 returned unharmed. Body cam footage is consistent with the surface of Teegarden's Star C as seen from the eyepiece.\n\n**Notes:** //There are 2 possible theories of what's happening here. One, it's creating some kind of internal wormhole and two, it's some kind of quantum shenanigan. I hope it's the former as quantum stuff gives me a headache.// - Dr. Andrews\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Experiment-8390-3**\n\n||||||||||||~ Target Body Name: Kepler-442 B ||\n||~ Type||~ Distance||~ Mass ||~ Radius ||~ Gravity||~ Temperature ||\n||= Super Earth ||= 1206ly||= 2.3M🜨 ||= 1.34R🜨 ||= 1.28G ||= 233°K (-40°C) ||\n\n**Intent:** Determine whether or not SCP-8390 has an upper range limit\n\n**Participating Subject:** D-3292\n\n**Procedure:** D-3292 was equipped with a reinforced EVA space suit and instructed to use SCP-8390 until teleportation occurred.\n\n**Observations:** SCP-8390 was unable to focus on the target.

Teleportation occurred after 30 minutes as expected, but was quickly disabled when the high surface temperatures began to damage the outer layers of D-3292's suit. Notably, any shed matter was returned despite no longer being physically attached to the suit.\n\n**Notes:** //Given the results of the last few tests, I think it's safe to say the limit is somewhere around a thousand light years.// - Dr. Andrews\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Experiment-8390-7**\n\n||||||||||||~ Target Body Name: HD 40307 G ||\n||~ Type||~ Distance||~ Mass ||~ Radius ||~ Gravity||~ Temperature ||\n||= Super Earth ||= 42ly||= 7.09M🜨 ||= 2.39R🜨 ||= 1.24G ||= 278°K (5°C) ||\n\n**Intent:** Determine what does and doesn't get taken with a subject when they use SCP-8390\n\n**Participating Subject:** D-3292\n\n**Procedure:** D-3292 was provided with 3 sealed containers hereafter SC-1, -2 and -3 respectively. SC-1 and -2 were given to D-3292 and SC-3 placed nearby. Upon teleportation, SC-1 was placed on the surface 1m away from the subject and SC-2 filled with a sample of the ground. SCP-8390 was then deactivated.\n\n**Observations:** Upon teleportation, SC-1 and -2 disappeared with the subject while SC-3 remained in place. Upon return, SC-1 reappeared at the subject's feet and SC-2 appeared in his hand. Camera footage shows procedure was indeed followed by the subject, however, both SC-1 and -2 were found to be empty.\n\n**Notes:** //It would seem that anything you wear or carry goes with you, but you can't bring anything back or leave anything behind. This should render the risk of extraterrestrial contamination to be minimal. I'm still recommending subjects at least get disinfected.

Unauthorised personnel will be subjected to immediate amnestication and disciplinary action.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Input Level 4 Credentials:\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\nDuring the course of SCP-8390's initial testing, several attempts were made by the Department of Astronomy to verify Prof. Coleman's discovery of life on the exoplanet TRAPPIST-1E. During this time, Dr. Andrews submitted a proposal to utilise SCP-8390 itself to verify said discovery once its capabilities had been established. Following the conclusion of testing on 18 February 2024, this proposal was granted and scheduled to be performed on 30 March. This, however, was abruptly forced into action sooner than expected due to the occurrence of Extranormal Event-8390.\n\nThe TRAPPIST-1 system consists of 6 exoplanets, each of which are tidally locked[[footnote]]A scenario where a body has a similar rotational period as its orbital period around a partner resulting in the same side permanently facing it.[[/footnote]] to the TRAPPIST-1 star and in extreme orbital proximity with an average distance between orbits of 0.03767 AU (Approximately 5.6 million km). On 22 March, all of said planets underwent simultaneous planetary synchronisation. This event directly corresponded with a series of gravitational and thaumic phenomenon which rapidly spread across the system at large. Overseer Command authorised an emergency expedition of TRAPPIST-1E via SCP-8390. The relevant test log is shown below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Experiment-8390-██**\n\n||||||||||||~ Target Body Name: TRAPPIST-1E ||\n||~ Type||~ Distance||~ Mass ||~ Radius ||~ Gravity||~ Temperature ||\n||= Terrestrial ||= 41ly||= 0.692M🜨 ||= 0.92R🜨 ||= 0.81G ||= 250°K (-23°C) ||\n\n**Intent:** Analyse anomalous phenomenon in the TRAPPIST-1 system caused by EE-8390\n\n**Participating Subject:** [REDACTED][[footnote]]By their own request, the subject's identity has been removed from the offical record.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Procedure:** SCP-8390 aligned with TRAPPIST-1E. Subject equiped with reinforced EVA space suit equiped with live video transmission and allowed to use SCP-8390 until teleportation occurred.\n\n**Observations:** Eyepiece view showed a cascade of anomalous phenomena occurring across the planet and the system at large including, but not limited to:\n\n* Shards of material being torn away by seemingly enhanced tidal forces of neighbouring planets\n* Regions of planets shifting between opaque and semi-transparent\n* Regions of planets shifting between solid and spectral states\n* Wildly fluctuating temperatures of the TRAPPIST-1 star\n* A permeating blue/purple hue enveloping the system which was not visible from the surface\n* The appearance of mountain based \"Barriers\" separating the day, night and twilight regions of TRAPPIST-1E\n\nAfter deliberation, SCP-8390 was aligned with the mid-twilight region of TRAPPIST-1E, shortly after which SCP-8390-1 reached full power and the subject was teleported. According to the subject, several semi-spectral lifeforms were visible, including what appeared to be trees, plants and several quad-pedal animals. SCP-8390 emergency deactivated after the region the subject was located in began to separate from the planet. Subject's suit decontaminated before release.\n\n**Notes:** //This is incredible! Not only was Prof. Coleman right all along but we've even observed an extrasolar anomalous phenomenon with greater accuracy than ever before!// - Dr. Andrews\n[[/div]]\n\nUnbeknownst to the observation and debriefing personnel, [REDACTED] had somehow been contaminated by an anomalous microorganism believed to have been created by the effects of EE-8390 and possibly several prior occurrences of this event. This organism (Hereafter AO-8390) apparently experiences illumination synced corporeality shifts, becoming physical and/or spectral in proportion to the local concentration of light; the subject is fully physical in illuminated environments but becomes spectral when exposed to lower light concentrations in similar levels to the twilight region of TRAPPIST-1E. As such, it had been incorporeal at the time of the exploration and apparently phased through [REDACTED]'s suit and into his body while on planet.\n\nWhile it is known that SCP-8390 naturally prevents matter not transported //to// the target planet from being taken //back// to Earth, as AO-8390 did not physically exist at this time, it was also brought back when SCP-8390 was disabled. Due to this teleportation from the dimly lit twilight region of TRAPPIST-1E to the fully illuminated Foundation facility, AO-8390 instantly regained corporeality, leaving it in an anomalously excited and energetic state. The subsequent events are documented as follows:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Incident-8390-1 Time log**\n\n**1805:** Subject is released after his debriefing on the exploration of TRAPPIST-1E\n\n**1810:** Subject begins complaining of nausea and disorientation. Believing this to be stress related or an undocumented side effect of SCP-8390, he is advised by one of his colleagues to head to the site medical wing.\n\n**1812:** Subject's body begins rapidly oscillating from opaque to semi-transparent. They are immediately detained by security personnel.\n\n**1817:** A second member of personnel also begins visually phasing. They are similarly detained.\n\n**1830:** Approximately 5% of onsite personnel are experiencing the anomalous phasing effects. Containment teams begin examinations to determine the cause of the effects. Site-51 placed on Gamma Alert.\n\n**1900:** Effects have spread to over 25% of personnel. The researchers observing Experiment-8390-██ theorise that the present scenario may be linked to the anomalous effects observed on TRAPPIST-1E. Research teams order full physiological screening of affected personnel.\n\n**1920:** Local authorities receive a 911 call from a civilian who has apparently also been infected by unknown means. Mobile Task Force deployed to disrupt further communications and suppress information.\n\n**1950:** Physiological screenings discover the presence of AO-8390 within all affected subjects. By this time, infection has spread to over 50% of personnel and 2% of the surrounding city. Foundation moles in local authorities place region on lockdown.\n\n**2010:** A power outage occurs in the holding cell where [REDACTED] and other infected personnel are located. Upon restoring power, the subject's phasing effect has noticeably weakened. Research teams are alerted to this discovery and begin emergency tests.\n\n**2027:** Infection has spread to over 10% of the local populace. Those infected for the longest time (aside those in the aforementioned power outage) have begun losing corporeality. Research Personnel theorise that if AO-8390 was incorporeal in the twilight region of TRAPPIST-1E but not in full light, it may lose cohesion with baseline reality in the darkness. The lights in the holding cells are disabled to test this.\n\n**2040:** Personnel in the holding cell have ceased phasing. Analysis reveals that AO-8390 is no longer present within subjects.\n\n**2042:** All power in the region is disabled in order to eliminate AO-8390 among civilians. This is apparently successful.\n\n**2100:** After nearly 20 minutes of darkness treatment, power is restored to the region. No further cases of AO-8390 are reported. Situation decleared resolved; Site-51 lifts lockdown.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the conclusion of Incident-8390-1, MTF Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\") was deployed to assist with clean up. Witnesses and affected civilians were administered Class-A amnestics and a cover story of a terrorist attack on a nearby power plant was distributed to local media outlets. The Special Containment Procedures for SCP-8390 were updated to prevent any future occurrences. AO-8390 is pending full SCP classification.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8389]]] | SCP-8390 | [[[SCP-8391]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** LargeTelescope\n> **Name:** The great wetherell refractor steampunk telescope for wiki\n> **Author:** Timwether\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/image/ce52c265-5c42-429e-9755-20f776e35f02?q=Refractor%20Telescope\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
