We have determined that Site-107 has experienced a Class M dimensional shift. 53 dead, 34 injured. 17 unaccounted for, may have been outside the building when the shift occurred. There are, um, there are 92 of us alive in here. 82 researchers, 8 D-Class. It has been… uh, 47 hours since the breach. \n\nOverwatch Command, we can’t open any of the doors.\n\nWe’ve lost all apparent communication with the outside world. No cell service, no internet, no… no responses to any radio transmissions. On-Site comms are still working, so are short-range walkies, but other than that, we don’t know if we have any connection to you or any other site. Our entire site is subterranean, so with the elevators broken, too, we have no way out.\n\nStill waiting to hear back about how much food and water we have. And oxygen, for that matter. Backup generator is working, but that has an expiration date on it too.\n\nIf anyone is hearing this transmission, please respond. Doesn’t have to be Overwatch Command.

Which is fine. All of this is fine! We’ll make it out of this! We’re the fucking Foundation, what can’t we do, right? The walls to the outside are… infinitely more wall, which is… on par for this kind of work! It’s all been pretty standard stuff, so far, I guess. Trapped with no outside contact in… the void? Maybe?

Hope you’re all feeling mellow, and if you’re not, just let the silky tones of this radio broadcast bring you to your happy place. \n\nIf you were wondering about the state of that wall we blew up, it… healed.

We're still here. We might have to repair some damaged equipment and hope that some of the walls- um- heal, but nevertheless. Everybody seems to be on the same page about at least one thing.\n\nWe are all still here.\n\nWe, the 92 survivors of what has now been dubbed Incident 6320-A, are here, and alive, and we have nothing to do.\n\nExcept our jobs, that is.\n\nUpper Management had a meeting and decided that the only way out of this is to keep doing what we’re all here to do in the first place: study SCP-6320. See what we can find out. See if any of what we find out can bring us home. Work definitely won’t be going back to normal, per se, but we’re a pocket dimension full of smart people and we’ll figure it out. It’s not like we have a choice to do anything else. \n\nIf the Foundation has taught me anything, it’s that the world is indeed a dark and terrible place full of dark and terrible things. If it wasn’t, the Foundation wouldn’t exist, would it? But I guess, in a manner of speaking, this dark and terrible place, it’s full of us. \n\nI’m assigned to report the goings-on as things develop, keep a log of everything that happens on site, with the scip and otherwise. So Overwatch Command, if you, by some impossible chance, happen to hear me, we’ll be here, securing, containing and protecting. Like we always do, like we’ve always done.\n\nThis has been Dr. Harley at Site-107, over and out. \n\nAnd if anyone else is intercepting this broadcast, find us. Preferably, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/findusalivehub find us alive].\n[[/div]]\n\n~~~~\n\n+++ END EPISODE\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
