Inside the chamber is a white board with water-soluble markers. On the north side is a mirror.\n\nStaff should treat the object like a human being, keeping in mind that their behaviour shapes the object. For this reason, access is restricted by a psychological evaluation and training by Senior Research Staff (primarily Dr. Richter). Access to the containment chamber of the object is only allowed with permission from the Site Director until SCP-148-DE's effect on objects and especially humans is understood.\n\nIn the event that SCP-148-DE escapes its containment chamber, the MTF DE28-𝕾 shall lure the object into a ℍ𝔼𝕃-transport containment that is at least a CBE-2 Zajin class. Personnel should be careful not to use unnecessarily violent methods to lure SCP-148-DE into the transport containment so as not to cause irritation.

SCP-148-DE often appears as a steadily moving sphere with an average diameter of two metres. The object is surrounded by a transparent membrane that holds together the fluid inside. SCP-148-DE's membrane exhibits exceptional plastic deformability, which allows it to deform almost without restriction. The membrane is selectively permeable, which allows certain objects to penetrate SCP-148-DE. For this reason, the surface is perceived as slightly sticky and pleasantly warm. SCP-148-DE is able to regulate its body temperature, even though it is strongly influenced by the room temperature. Where it gets its energy from is under investigation. So far, it has not been required to consume any form of food, apart from negligible amounts of liquid. \n\nSCP-148-DE is capable of reaching a velocity of 10 m/s, although it never normally exceeds 1.2 m/s.  Examination of tissue samples revealed that SCP-148-DE consists mainly of water and animal proteins. SCP-148-DE has a pH of 5.5 at last examination. \n\nSCP-148-DE did not respond to auditory and visual stimuli at the beginning of its containment, but this changed during its time in the custody of the SCP Foundation. SCP-148-DE appears to be intelligent, perhaps even possessing the intelligence of a human being. The object uses outgrowths to pick up objects or touch personnel. It reshapes these each time, only to reabsorb them into the base mass later. The object has so far shown great interest in Foundation personnel and interacted intensively with the maintenance staff and researchers present. Researchers and agents stated that SCP-148-DE is very cautious and gently scans their bodies. It removed possessions several times and apparently studied them, before returning them. SCP-148-DE appears to make active attacks difficult by dodging and deforming. When attempting to take samples, the object formed club-like outgrowths and fought back with them. Dr. Sturm suspected it mistook the researchers for predators in this case.  \n\n**Discovery:** SCP-148-DE was found by a group of senior citizens in an abandoned house. It was subsequently brought to site-DE16-EX to initiate investigations. After the discovery of [*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-042-de SCP-042-DE], SCP-148-DE was relocated.\n\n\n**Addendum:** SCP-148-DE continues to evolve through interactions. Thus, the object increasingly began to change its shape to have semi-human features. On 10 June 2003, it was able to form itself completely into a copy of the present [*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/personalakte-von-dr-faust Dr. S. Faust], [*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/personalakte-von-agent-peterson Agent A. Peterson], Dr. M. von Reichstein and Dr. A. von Reichstein. In doing so, it did not alter its colouring. Since then, this behaviour has not changed and SCP-148-DE actively began to imitate the actions. For better communication, the object was therefore taught to write. It was noticeable that SCP-148-DE learned this quickly and partly began to develop new creations for missing terms.\n\n[[include component:coltop show=⇥ Communication with SCP-148-DE ⇤|hide=⇃ Communication with SCP-148-DE ⇂|folded=true|ifprot=true]]\n> //Foreword: This is SCP-148-DE's first interview.
