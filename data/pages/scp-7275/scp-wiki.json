No personnel are to handle SCP-7275-1-B without Foundation-issue blade-resistant protective wear.\n\nSCP-7275 is to meet with psychiatric personnel designated by the Ethics Committee on a semi-monthly basis.  It is not to be exposed to any potential visual or auditory triggers not first cleared by its assigned psychiatrist.  SCP-7275 is permitted free access to all Level 1 security areas and recreational facilities with an armed escort of no fewer than two Site security staff and is to document its daily routine in a journal for psychiatric review.\n\nAt its request, SCP-7275 has been granted the following amenities:\n* A sleeping cot\n* A wooden desk and chair\n* A record player\n* Reading material\n\nSCP-7275 wears an ankle monitor containing a tranquilizing payload which is to be injected into its bloodstream if it enters a hostile state. Site security personnel are to be advised that conventional firearms have little effect against the entity.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7275 resembles a heavily bandaged humanoid male dressed in attire common to the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Subject is Caucasian, has green eyes, brown hair, and greatly disfigured facial features which it conceals in gauze. It is 1.88 m tall and 88.45 kg in weight.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width= 300px\n|url=WW1\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-7275 photographed in France, 1918\n]]\n\nSCP-7275 possesses a wide variety of war wounds common to different time periods. These wounds include, but are not limited to, burns, bullet wounds––including musket ball wounds––and stab wounds across its upper body.  It possesses bruising along the neck that appears to have been left by multiple attempted hanging executions. It also possesses large scars across its middle and lower body, indicating that it has been bisected and dismembered at multiple points in time. SCP-7275 also shows signs of radiation poisoning, measured at 11 Gy[[footnote]] A Gray(Gy) is a unit of absorbed radiation equal to one joule per kg of matter [[/footnote]], from an unidentified injury. Due to these injuries and others, the majority of its body is covered in scarred and necrotic tissue. It appears to have attempted to treat many of these wounds itself with crude sutures.\n\nSCP-7275 possesses a baseline calm demeanor. It claims to have participated in every major American war and demonstrates extensive experience with military roles.  Its preferred language is English, however, it is also fluent in French and several Algonquian[[footnote]] A language family belonging to indigenous North American tribes stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the east coast [[/footnote]] languages.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=left\n|width= 300px\n|url=Challenger\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-7275 combatting an unidentified entity in Kyoto, 1945\n]]\n\nDespite being largely compliant with Foundation personnel, SCP-7275 demonstrates signs of severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)[[footnote]] An anxiety disorder that develops in reaction to physical injury or severe mental or emotional distress, such as military combat [[/footnote]]. It is prone to unpredictable and often violent episodes if exposed to visual or auditory triggers that simulate a combat scenario.\n\nSCP-7275 is biologically immortal and claims to have been born in 1751, in the (at the time) British colony of Massachusetts. It does not appear to age and can withstand grievous bodily harm, including the loss of vital organs but, can be rendered inactive by sufficient damage. In this state, SCP-7275 is incapable of reconstituting itself without outside assistance.\n\nSCP-7275-1 is the collective designation for anomalous objects carried by SCP-7275. In the event that any instance is damaged or lost, SCP-7275 possesses the ability to produce them from inside its coat. The means by which it accomplishes this is believed to be thaumaturgical in nature.\n\nSCP-7275-1-A is a smoothbore musket similar in model to an American Revolutionary War-era Brown Bess. It possesses an inscription reading \"Dogood\" across the stock. SCP-7275-1-A fires with a force more comparable to modern-era high-caliber rifles, and is capable of autonomously reloading itself.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width= 350px\n|url=Dogood\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-7275-1-A (bottom) and SCP-7275-1-B (top)\n]]\n\nSCP-7275-1-B is a sword bayonet that is typically affixed to the end of SCP-7275-1-A but can be detached or summoned separately at the discretion of SCP-7275. It is 55.9 cm long and weighs 2.5 kg. The bayonet is composed of an unidentified silvery metal composite which appears to be the result of an attempt to replicate Berylium Bronze. It possesses a similar weight and tensile strength but lacks its other extraneously anomalous properties. SCP-7275 is not fully aware of the origins of the metal but claims that SCP-7275-1-B was forged from a larger stockpile held by the American Continental Congress. Investigation into the metal and any other applications of it by the American government remains ongoing.\n\nAt SCP-7275's discretion, it may inflict a target it pierces with SCP-7275-1-B with a wound it has suffered across its lifetime. Any subsequent scarring from these wounds on the body of SCP-7275 will heal as a consequence of using this property, and each wound can only be utilized once.\n\nSCP-7275-1-C is a brass survey compass. It does not appear to possess any extraneous anomalous properties except that it can be summoned from SCP-7275's coat.\n\nSCP-7275-1-D is a silver locket necklace that has been thaumaturgically sealed shut. SCP-7275 has stated that it possesses the ability to open it, but has refused to do so or to describe its contents.\n\n**Addendum 7275.1:** \n\nSCP-7275 was first observed by the Foundation on September 26th, 2002.\n\nFollowing reports of a heavily bandaged man meandering through Jowzjon, Afghanistan, Containment Specialist Johnathan Hooke tracked its movements to the Leili Desert. At 0643 hours, SCP-7275 was discovered sitting on a rock staring at the sunset. It did not resist attempts at containment.\n\nSCP-7275 was relocated to Site-228 for processing. It was discovered carrying several nonanomalous personal items. These include:\n* A damaged metal compass with the initials \"JPJ\"[[footnote]] Possible connection to Revolutionary War naval captain John Paul Jones, warrants further investigation [[/footnote]] inscribed inside its lid\n* An obsidian arrowhead\n* A rusted Bowie knife\n* A Civil War-era US infantry insignia\n* A World War I-era German Iron Cross\n* A rusted .50 cal shell casing\n* A deck of playing cards with a missing king of hearts\n* A leatherbound pocket journal. The interior contains over 2,000 tally marks, with an exact number difficult to determine due to smudging and fading over time\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶Interview 7275.1◀\" hide=\"▽Interview 7275.1▽\"]]\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n> **Interview Log 7275.1**\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Specialist Johnathan Hooke\n> \n> **Interviewed:** SCP-7275\n> \n> **Date:** 09/08/2002\n> \n> **Location:** Site-228, temporary containment unit\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Hooke:** [Slumps files on the table] Alright SCP-7275, let's get this over with so we can figure out who to haul you off to.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** My name is Lawrence, Lawrence Taylor.

So you're from the Army, then?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** You're... not? Are you an officer of the law, then?\n> \n> **Hooke:** Nope, not cops either. Just researchers. Well– //I'M// not a researcher per se, just the closest thing you've got 'til we know what to do with you. Let's go back a step. You said you're with the Army?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** [Sighs] I am. You're American, at least, so kindly direct me to the relevant authorities.\n> \n> **Hooke:** Okay, touchy, I get it. You didn't comply with medical examiners; you seem pretty protective of those bandages. But I don't need to have a doctorate to know a normal man in your condition shouldn't be breathing, much less walking across a desert. Care to explain?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Just some old war wounds. They don't hurt quite as bad as they look.\n> \n> **Hooke:** Yeah? Which war?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** [Sits back and appears to ponder] Well, most recently, the current Afghan theater. Before that, Iraq, Vietnam, Korea, the Pacific, the Great War, and I've lost count of all the others since the Revolution.\n> \n> **Hooke:** Phew, okay then. Bit of a world traveler, aren't we.

Level 3 Researcher Dr. Daisy Loche was designated the lead researcher of SCP-7275 on her request due to her extensive academic background in American history and anthropology. Dr. Loche determined, after initial testing procedures, that SCP-7275's properties were thaumaturgical in nature.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶Interview 7275.2◀\" hide=\"▽Interview 7275.2▽\"]]\nUpon SCP-7275's arrival to Site-19, it was introduced to Dr. Loche for an inquiry into its background.\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n> **Interview Log 7275.3**\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Level 3 Researcher Daisy Loche\n> \n> **Interviewed:** SCP-7275\n> \n> **Date:** 09/10/2002\n> \n> **Location:** Site-19\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Loche:** Good evening, 7275. I hope you're settling in well. My name is Dr. Loche, you and I will be working together for some time.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** A pleasure, Doctor.  However, I am unfortunately not in need of a clinician at this time.  As I attempted to explain to that Hooke gentleman, I need to return to my unit.\n> \n> **Loche:** Oh, I'm actually not that kind of doctor, but that's beside the point. Unfortunately, I don't think we can't allow you to return at this time. As I'm sure Specialist Hooke explained to you, part of our organization's mission is to study anomalous individuals such as yourself, and part of that includes keeping you here at these facilities.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Perhaps I should apologize, Dr. Loche, because I don't expect I will be staying here against my will.  Uncle Sam will be quick to remove me from your custody.\n> \n> **Loche:** So you were staying with the US military by choice, then?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** I haven't been discharged, if that's what you're asking. But I never asked to be; they don't need to twist my arm to make me fight for my country.\n> \n> **Loche:** Oh... uh, I think they may have done more than twisted it. I think it was a mistake for you not to accept medical attention.\n> \n> [The stitching on 7275's left arm comes undone and it falls off onto the ground. It was later determined that the patchwork was damaged prior to its containment in Afghanistan]\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Oh for the love–– [sighs] Call your medic.\n> \n> **Loche:** I don't think that will be necessary, hold your arm–– er, shoulder steady.\n> \n> [Dr. Loche produces a first aid kit from under the desk and withdraws a sewing needle. SCP-7275 uses its right hand to hold its severed arm in place as Loche repairs its sutures]\n> \n> **Loche:** [Still sewing] 7275, I respect your sense of duty. But am I correct in assuming that you serve your country because you want to protect the people in it?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** That would be a fair way to put it.\n> \n> **Loche:** Well... We're not so different then. The P in \"Protect\" goes both ways, we're not just protecting anomalies like you, but we try to find better ways to keep the outside world safe. That's why \"Uncle Sam\" lets us work here.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** You're affiliated with the US government?\n> \n> **Loche:** They're actually one of our biggest donors, believe it or not.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Let's go back a step, you think you need to protect the people out there from me?  I've been fighting for them longer than a single one of them has been alive!\n> \n> **Loche:** Please don't move. No, not necessarily. We also use the entities here, and our research on them, to stop other, more dangerous ones. Eldritch gods, immortal monsters–– sometimes even armies and terrorist groups. The difference, though, is that we're also in this to save everyone worldwide.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** So... you're like the United Nations?\n> \n> **Loche:** [Under her breath] Heh, the GOC wishes...\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** What was that?\n> \n> **Loche:** Nevermind. The point is that there are some real monsters out there. I'm sure the military may have even deployed you against some. And you could do just as much good for the world by helping us here as you did out there. [Cuts the thread] And... done!\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** [Rotates its arm] Heh, good as new. You really know your way around a surgeon's knot, Doctor.\n> \n> **Loche:** Well, I was an army brat... [hesitates] and my mom was a single mother. It teaches you resourcefulness.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** [Laughs and looks into the security camera] I like this one. [Turns back to Loche] You make a good case, Doctor. I'd like to learn more about this Foundation of yours.\n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 7275.2:**\n\nDuring an investigation in January of 2003, SCP-7275's claims of participation in American military conflicts were corroborated by material dated from the First World War uncovered in the American National Archives.\n\nContemporary reports detailed an ongoing investigation into a bandaged humanoid that was sighted fighting throughout the Meuse–Argonne offensive. This humanoid, which was sighted with the American 128th Machine Gun Battalion, was reported to have fought uninhibited by exposure to mustard gas and to have neutralized several dozen German operatives despite its usage of 'severely outdated' weaponry.\n\nMilitary records from the Revolutionary War classified Top Secret identify SCP-7275 as Lawrence P. Taylor, a volunteer recruit who joined the 1st Massachusetts Regiment on April 26, 1775. Taylor was declared deceased on May 10, 1775 during the Siege of Boston, after being slain via bayonet. His remains were transported for weapons testing to the Dogood Society, a North American organization of intellectuals and academics active during the 18th century studying and developing anomalous entities, objects and artifacts for use in the American Revolution.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶Documents Relevant to the Dogood Society◀\" hide=\"▽Documents Relevant to the Dogood Society▽\"]]\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the notes of Benjamin Franklin[[footnote]] An American Founding Father, inventor, and diplomat [[/footnote]], who was identified as the founder of the Dogood Society:\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n> It is mayhaps in ill-kept secret, one advertised relentlessly in the News Papers of Europe, that the Crown's Men have us outmanned, outgunned, and outresourced.

Contrived from the laborious research of the myriad polymaths and natural philosophers who constitute our organization, not the least of which, should I less-than humbly but deservedly note, myself, as well as through the aid of our Benefactor, we have successfully revived one of the young bloods lost in Boston.  We were unable to replicate the properties of the young Semitic Gentleman with total sameness, however, the results were astonishing in their own right. Once our newly alive compatriot is outfitted with weaponry befitting of such an infantryman as himself, I have scant doubt the war shall soon show us favor.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width= 200px\n|url=Propaganda\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-7275 prior to its disfigurement as depicted in contemporary wartime propaganda\n]]\n\nSCP-7275 was first deployed by the US military in July of 1775. It saw extensive usage by the Continental Army in the Battle(s) of Chelsea Creek, Falmouth, Bunker Hill, Great Bridge, and Sullivan's Island as well as the Siege of Yorktown. Further classified documents reveal that after the end of the American Revolution, SCP-7275 was retained as a permanent member of the United States Army.\n\nSCP-7275 was later deployed in fourteen armed conflicts involving the United States military, including the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, the Philippine War, both World Wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the Afghanistan War, where the American government lost contact with it following an IED[[footnote]] Improvised Explosive Device [[/footnote]] explosion and subsequently declared it Missing In Action. Though SCP-7275 does not have an exact confirmed kill count, it is estimated to have several hundred for each conflict it has participated in.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 7275.3:**\n\n6 months after initial containment without incident, The Director of Site-19 put in an order to explore potential applications of SCP-7275 as a Foundation asset.  Specialist Johnathan Hooke was assigned to test the entity's combat proficiency.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶Hooke's Findings◀\" hide=\"▽Hooke's Findings▽\"]]\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n> SCP-7275 is every bit as impressive as you'd expect from someone with a quarter of a millennia of military experience.  That gun sure packs more of a punch than it has any right to, and 7275 hasn't missed a shot in the two months he's spent at the range.  He's also a deadly son of a gun in close quarters, he doesn't seem to have any fear instinct whatsoever; probably from having survived most known ways to kill a man shy of being shot into the Sun.  He's a proper fella too; obeys orders without a second thought and seems eager to be part of a team.  Old habits die hard, I suppose.\n> \n> I absolutely, unequivocally recommend SCP-7275 for integration into the Foundation as an MTF personnel.  It might just be the best soldier to ever step foot through those vaulted doors; we might as well make him one of ours.\n> \n> ––Specialist Johnathan Hooke\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶MTF Rho-76◀\" hide=\"▽MTF Rho-76▽\"]]\nAfter approving Specialist Hooke's recommendation, the Director of Site-19 formally established MTF Rho-76 (\"Shell Heads\"), a provisional team that would specialize in the containment of anomalies embedded in military organizations. SCP-7275 was designated as a member of its weapons squad, with Dr. Daisy Loche, as the head of its research team, serving as its primary handler.\n\nSCP-7275 was noted as being \"enthusiastic\" about the program by Dr. Loche, and offered to assist in the training of Rho-76 recruits.  It handpicked 13 agents, all of whom had assorted backgrounds in the United States Army Special Forces, to join the team on its maiden operation.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶Performance Report◀\" hide=\"▽Performance Report▽\"]]\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n------\n**Item #:** SCP-Alpha-435\n\n**Object Class:** Uncontained\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the highly destructive nature of SCP-Alpha-435 and the Foundation's inability to contain it––due to its protection by the Russian Federation––termination has been approved to prevent any military application of the anomaly and likely subsequent mass casualties.\n\nMTF strike plans are pending, due to the small number of agents that would have to be utilized in any such operation to maintain secrecy and prevent open conflict between the Foundation and the Russian Federation.\n\n**Description:** SCP-Alpha-435 is a large, cybernetic ursine entity. According to Kremlin documents, it stands 4.89 m on its hind legs and weighs 1,020 kg. SCP-Alpha-435 possesses a titanium skeleton and is powered by a small modular nuclear fission reactor, and possesses a variety of combat enhancements including:\n* A bulletproof hide\n* Retractable claws\n* Varied ballistic weaponry\n* A plasma breath attack\n* Infrared, X-Ray and Night Vision\n\nAlthough SCP-Alpha-435 was manufactured by the Russian government, it is believed to be sentient and incredibly hostile to organic life.  It subsists primarily on U-235 and various government-manufactured dietary supplements.  SCP-Alpha-435 is believed to have been created for use in the Chechen War.\n\n------\n\n**Afterword:** This is an untenable situation. Russia isn't the only military power to use anomalous objects, but they seem to have no care for discretion whatsoever. Talking tanks, I can handle. A Revolutionary War-era super soldier? Why not. But this? It's absolutely ludicrous that any government should be weaponizing something this indiscreet, let alone in civilian zones as the Russians are planning in Chechnya. We cannot allow any government, even a major power to expose anomalies to the world for the sake of a guerrilla war.\n\nAt the same time, the Foundation also doesn't want to make enemies of the Russian Federation. What we need is plausible deniability, a small and undetected strike force that they could reasonably blame on anybody. The Americans, the Chinese, the GOC, they might even suspect us, but at least they won't be sure enough to strike back. We can get agents into this facility, but fifteen at most without raising any eyebrows.\n\nO5 would do well to consider including an anomaly on that list to give them a fighting chance, I recommend Rho-76 for the task.

The agents of Rho-76 regularly volunteered to serve as its escorts in order to spend time with it.\n\nOn 4/15/2003, SCP-7275 entered the Level 1 break room where it conversed with the other members of Rho-76. Subjects included accounts of the members’ respective military deployments, and the agents attempting to catch SCP-7275 up on contemporary popular culture by introducing it to modern music.\n\nAt one point, Agent Reynolds [codename: “Foxtrot”] heated up his lunch in the microwave. SCP-7275 looked uneasily at the microwave as it began producing a “humming” sound, and said nothing as the conversation continued around it. It notably began tightening its grip on the armrests of its chair as the sound grew louder.\n\nAfter approximately 45 seconds, the microwave finished and began beeping. At this point, SCP-7275’s grip caused it to splinter its chair. It entered a frantic state and tore the microwave out of the wall before fleeing with it from the room. After failing to calm it down verbally, SCP-7275's escort activated the sedative in its ankle bracelet, incapacitating it.\n\nSCP-7275 demonstrated signs of insomnia after this incident, averaging 2 hours of sleep a night. It was allowed to access the facility again with an increased escort, but displayed agoraphobic[[footnote]] An anxiety disorder involving the fear of areas where escape is difficult, and both open and closed spaces [[/footnote]] tendencies such as avoiding rooms with single points of entry and exit, noises from electrical instruments, and areas obscured by large objects, such as cubicles. Its escorts also reported that SCP-7275 would randomly grab its left shoulder.\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n> **Interview Log 7275.3**\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Level 3 Researcher Daisy Loche\n> \n> **Interviewed:** SCP-7275\n> \n> **Date:** 04/20/2003\n> \n> **Location:** Site-19\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Loche:** 7275?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** [Does not respond]\n> \n> **Loche:** Lawrence, this isn’t like you.

But I only did what I thought was right at the time––I thought that damned thing was– Oh, forget it.\n> \n> **Loche:** What did you think it was, Lawrence?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** [Sighs] I thought it was an explosive. Can you blame me? It certainly sounded like one.\n> \n> **Loche:** Your teammates mentioned that you keep grabbing your arm. Is there something that happened to it that may be bothering you?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Oh, loads of things have happened to it. It’s been shot, stabbed, severed, and burned just like the rest of me.\n> \n> **Loche:** Perhaps something more distinct? Maybe something related to your memory loss before we found you?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Please spare me your conjecture, and stop hyperfixating on every little movement I make. I’m not grabbing my arm, I’m not thinking about my arm, and I don’t care about my arm. I could tear it off and sew it back on again and it would still work just as well.\n> \n> **Loche:** Well something is clearly bothering you, because you've barely slept in almost a week. Maybe this isn't good for you? Perhaps we should reduce your deployments, and see how that helps with your insomnia.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** I don’t need to sleep, doctor. What, I can survive heavy ballistics but you draw the line at late nights and early mornings?\n> \n> **Loche:** It won’t kill you, no. But sleep deprivation is quite literally a form of torture. You can’t function like this.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** And that’s no fault of some buried memory you keep trying to poke at. I have sutures in my throat that agitate my breathing, from an old gas attack. That makes it difficult to sleep. It’s nothing else.\n> \n> **Loche:** Then perhaps you would like to use some form of a breathing apparatus? There are ways to fix sleep apnea.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Yes, more of your machines that beep and whir. No, thank you, I don’t have any desire to sleep with one on my face.\n> \n> **Loche:** Listen, you obviously need some form of treatment. But all that we’re trying to find out right now is whether it’s medical, or [pauses].\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Or what? [Becomes noticeably agitated] Or what, doctor? Say it––“psychological.” You think I’ve gone crazy? That I need to be monitored like some kind of child?\n> \n> **Loche:** I never said that.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** No, I’m sure you would have put it in much softer terms than that, the humanitarian that you are. But the meaning is the same. No, doctor. I don’t need your help.\n> \n> **Loche:** Lawrence, you really should consider treatment––.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** [Stands up] And //you// should consider your next words very carefully. I am a soldier, dammit! It’s not my profession, it’s //what I am//. I have fought on every corner of the earth, I’ve been torn down and rebuilt from scraps of flesh, and I have braved the worst fears of the strongest men on earth unflinchingly!

It appeared to enjoy classical music by 18th-century English and German composers, however, it also particularly enjoyed \"Like a Rolling Stone\" by Bob Dylan.

It reconstituted itself after six days, and was documented as entering a \"dissociative state\" for another three. The following is an excerpt from a subsequent psychiatric assessment of SCP-7275:\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n> The asset appears to be suffering from an acute case of battle fatigue. This is not to be unexpected, and, frankly, I am shocked this didn't become a problem sooner. Mr. Taylor has graced our mortuary four times already this war, but he has been defending the interests of the United States for generations. I've examined his file, and I am shocked he escaped the incident in Japan with his sanity intact. Death by immolation was simply the straw that broke the camel's back.\n> \n> It is my assessment that Mr. Taylor is wholly unfit for continued military service given his current psychiatric state and should be discharged immediately.\n> \n> Signed,\n> Dr. Elisabeth P. Nichols,\n> U.S. Army Nurse Corps\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nDr. Nichols' petition to mandate a medical discharge for SCP-7275 was denied by supervising military personnel.

The Asset––and it is again stressed that Dr. Nichols respect protocol and not call the entity \"Mr.\"––is and has always been a vital component of the United States Army, and his services are, as always, invaluable to the Vietnam Theater.\n> \n> What, we should ask the good doctor, would be waiting for Asset Taylor outside the military if we discharged him?  He has not been integrated into civilian life since before the telegram was invented, he has nobody to take him in and would not be able to acclimate to modern society.  More importantly than that, Taylor is a walking, talking military secret.  Dr. Nichols would do well to remember that she is one of the only Americans of her security clearance with knowledge of his existence.

All files regarding the mission were deleted from military databases.  However, bodycam footage recovered by Foundation plants within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) revealed the following details:\n\n> = **VIDEO LOG**\n> ----\n> **DATE:** 08/19/2002\n> \n> **LOCATION:** Helmand, Afghanistan\n> \n> **NOTE:** All recovered footage is taken by the bodycam recordings of SCP-7275, Delta Force operatives, and American surveillance drones\n> \n> ----\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **0300 hours:** Eight Delta Force operatives assume vantage points outside the perimeter of the compound.

SCP-7275 emerged from an automatic door on the container and began engaging the Taliban operatives.\n> \n> The entity slays three in quick succession with SCP-7275-1-B.

When all Taliban operatives are neutralized, SCP-7275 tears down the gate to the compound to allow the Delta Force operatives to enter the facility.\n> \n> SCP-7275 then proceeds to the entrance to the facility's interior. Mission Leader Alvin Reed shouts at the entity to wait, but it is too late to stop it from opening the door. SCP-7275 triggers an IED underneath, severing its left arm. At this point, approximately thirty more Taliban operatives emerge from the building in an ambush, killing seven of the Delta Force operatives. SCP-7275 sits unresponsive to the orders of Leader Reed and appears to enter a dissociative state.\n> \n> Leader Reed attempts to grab SCP-7275, at which point the entity pierces him with SCP-7275-1-B, causing him to immolate and collapse after several seconds. SCP-7275 then detaches SCP-7275-1-B, wielding it as a melee weapon, and charges the Taliban combatants. It slashes one nearby, causing barbed wire to manifest and entangle him. SCP-7275 then proceeds through the rest of the compound, dispatching another seven enemy combatants, who all become perforated with what appear to be various gunshot wounds when cut by the bayonet.\n> \n> At one point, a Taliban operative mans a machine gun turret mounted on a humvee and fires on SCP-7275's position. The entity hurls SCP-7275-1-B at the combatant, piercing him in the chest. The enemy swells and combusts in an incendiary explosion, igniting the vehicle and neutralizing several other combatants in the ensuing explosion.\n> \n> SCP-7275 then summons SCP-7275-1-A through its coat and neutralizes the rest of the combatants present.

[Laughs] Elisabeth.  Doctor, let me tell you, never in the two hundred years before I met her, or in the half-century since have I met anybody like that woman.  Do you want to know, as sick as it is, why I could never stop fighting after I met her?  Even if I always knew she wouldn't want it?\n> \n> **Loche:** Why?\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Because the day I stop coming back is the day I can finally see her again. I think I'm far past the point of living \"the simple life\" now, but... I think she always believed I was more than a fighter.

Did you know that?\n> \n> **Loche:** [Hesitates] She may have mentioned you enjoyed it in her notes, but I don't recall exactly.\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** [Appears to study Dr. Loche] You look––.\n> \n> **Loche:**  [Interrupts SCP-7275 by opening a file in front of it] 7275, the Ethics Committee has assembled a therapy regimen that we think could be extremely helpful. Certain parts of this are elective, but I truly recommend that you take full advantage of it. [Dr. Loche leaves the file on the desk and exits the room]\n> \n> **SCP-7275:** Thank you, doctor...\n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing this interview, SCP-7275 was removed from Rho-76. Dr. Loche and representatives of the Ethics Committee rewrote its containment procedures for the further study and treatment of its psychiatric condition.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSCP-7275's mandatory psychiatric journal logs have revealed previous injuries not disclosed to the Foundation upon its initial research, including from its alleged presence in Nagasaki, Japan on a covert mission during the city's nuclear bombing in 1945.\n\nOutside of the specified special containment procedures, Specialist Hooke and SCP-7275's former teammates on Rho-76 were approved to take SCP-7275 to the Site-19 range for recreational target practice on a semimonthly basis to attempt to give it a positive association with some of its triggers. These members include Agent Sullivan [Gecko], who has made a full recovery from his injuries and expressed a desire to help with 7275's treatment.\n\nAdditionally, SCP-7275 has been approved to take an active role in the training of incoming MTF personnel on encounters with humanoid and military-related anomalies, both for the Foundation to utilize its talents in a more risk-free capacity and to offer it more opportunities for human interaction.\n\nSCP-7275 has free access to the Foundation's regular amenities for treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including interaction with [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-999 SCP-999] under armed supervision.\n\nAs of a regularly scheduled psychiatric update on June 2007, incidents of SCP-7275's panic attacks have decreased by 36 percent, and its score on a Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) style self-reporting test has improved from 58 to 44 on symptoms of PTSD out of a maximum of 60. Treatment remains ongoing.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"ACCESS RESTRICTED: LEVEL 4 CREDENTIALS REQUIRED\" hide=\"Closing\"]]\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n> = **[AUTHENTIFICATION SUCCESSFUL]**\n> \n> = **Psychiatric Update Meeting**\n> \n> = **Date: June 13th, 2007**\n> \n> = Level 3 Researcher Dr. Daisy Loche\n> = &\n> = Level 3 Psychiatrist, Ethics Committee Assignee, Dr. Dawson Heard\n> \n------\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Heard:** Dr. Loche, a pleasure.\n> \n> **Loche:** Likewise Dr. Heard. What do you have for me?\n> \n> **Heard:** I think you'll find treatment has been having a positive effect on 7275, he seems to be settling well into his new role in MTF training. Although I'm sure you were as troubled as I was by his journal, I don't think even he understands the full scope of the damage done to his body. His mind, though, has proven incredibly strong, however damaged it is.\n> \n> **Loche:** That... wasn't exactly put delicately, but it seems like good news. I've had the same conclusion myself, he seems to be in much higher spirits, even though his attacks haven't been fully eliminated yet.\n> \n> **Heard:** Dr. Loche, respectfully... There is no \"yet.\" Odds are that what he saw over the past 250 years will stay with him for however many decades or centuries he still has left. Our goal here is to teach him how to better understand and manage those feelings and to improve his quality of life however we can, but there are some things not even the Foundation can fully repair.\n> \n> **Loche:** I... I know that.\n> \n> **Heard:** ...Doctor, if I may, the Committee has been very impressed in your handling of 7275.  You've been his staunchest advocate, and helped him carve out a life here at the Foundation even though war is all he's ever known. He has friends and colleagues as you would expect for a normal person. Though I'm certain he could use family, as well. Why haven't you told him about your relation to Dr. Nichols?\n> \n> **Loche:** My mom is my business too, you know. [Pauses] I didn't know about Lawrence until my mom died. She thought I deserved to know, I guess. I'm not the only person to grow up without a dad in their lives, and I could handle that. But imagine growing up and learning that your dad is an almost 300-year-old superweapon, who's been getting killed and stitched back together over and over and over again while your whole life you just thought he was a deadbeat, or just... well... //dead//. It was... difficult to process. Do you know why she named me \"Daisy\"?\n> \n> **Heard:** Enlighten me.\n> \n> **Loche:** Because in Vietnam, she used powdered daisies to treat his new wounds and scars. I guess the flower was some kind of an inside joke between them. So yeah, it's pretty weird. But what about the other side of that? What if I told him that he left his Elisabeth, the only person he's loved in centuries, as a single mother, and that all this time he's had a kid out there? Do you actually think //that// would help him, with everything he's already dealing with?\n> \n> **Heard:** Well, do you wish you didn't know about him?\n> \n> **Loche:** Of course I'm glad I know. But my way of coping was to go from being an Ivy League historian to working at... [waves her hands at the room around her] ...//this// place, just so I could help him.  He doesn't need that kind of stress.\n> \n> **Heard:** Alternatively, I think he might be glad to know he has family out there. 7275 is from a completely different world. Everyone he knows is dead, including your mother. The man listens to a record player, and even that kind of technology seems futuristic to him. You might make him feel less alone the same way he did you.\n> \n> **Loche:** [Holds her forehead] God, you're not psychoanalyzing me too, are you? I'm not your patient here. [Exhales] Maybe eventually, but not right now.\n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7274]]] | SCP-7275 | [[[SCP-7276]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
