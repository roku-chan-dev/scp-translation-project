Researchers will pose as either managers or employees of SCP-6632. If SCP-6632 exceeds its budget for any fiscal year, it will temporarily close under the guise of renovations until further appropriations have been secured.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6632 is a sentient taco restaurant named \"Tcao Time\"[[footnote]]Presumably based on the local \"Taco Time\" series of restaurants; food produced in SCP-6632 is sourced by \"Taco Time\" suppliers, and it is listed as a \"Taco Time\" franchise in company records.[[/footnote]] located in the West Valley Mall in Spokane, Washington, United States of America, Earth.\n\nSCP-6632's brain consists of a large mass of fat and neurons located in a cavity behind the main \"Tcao Time\" sign. These neurons extend to many of the appliances inside the store, including the cash register, stove, fryer, and refrigerator. SCP-6632 communicates by printing words and crude figures onto the cash register's thermal paper. SCP-6632 is not capable of arithmetic or higher-order mathematical reasoning.\n\nSCP-6632's brain has been extensively damaged. SCP-6632 possesses the approximate mental capacity of a five year old child, and simple questions can require several days of thought before a coherent response.\n\nSCP-6632 consumes food produced during its normal operation. Food is consumed via a hole located near the deep fryer; food inserted into the hole is conveyed upwards to a large digestive pouch via a small series of mechanical conveyor belts. As the rate of food return is high, SCP-6632 is easily able to ingest its required daily caloric intake.\n\nSCP-6632 secretes a mixture of glycerine and additives through several holes located in the ceiling of the kitchen area. This fluid appears to act as cushioning for SCP-6632's brain and digestive organ. This mixture is nontoxic and is not anomalous.\n\nAccording to the owner of SCP-6632, brain damage occurred when the sign was removed to fix the typo. The owner, thinking that the biological material was mold, attempted to remove it with bleach. An estimated 70% of SCP-6632's brain was damaged during this procedure.\n\nSCP-6632 first came to Foundation attention when it was discovered that the owner of SCP-6632 was selling large amounts of a glycerine-based mixture to a group of fetishists[[footnote]]The mixture, when placed in adult diapers, is ideal cushioning for aroused genitalia.[[/footnote]] online. Chemical tests by the purchaser revealed that the material had not been commercially synthesized.\n\nThe previous manager of SCP-6632 purchased the restaurant from the West Valley Mall, where it previously sat abandoned. No records indicate when SCP-6632 was constructed. Historical photographs indicate that its existence appears to at least date to the construction of the mall, and may predate it.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6631]]] | SCP-6632 | [[[SCP-6633]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
