She was the most wonderful, sweetest woman who ever lived and what happened to her was cruel and unfair. I would have dreams where I'd see her and be with her, but they too were unfair because I'd always have to wake up to a world she wasn't in anymore. \n\nI've had a lot of pretty desperate thoughts over the last few months and found myself in some terrible places. Losing loved ones is always hard, but worse is seeing the imprint of their lives in the grief of others who cared about them, too. My pappy lost his wife of nearly sixty years, my mom lost her mother. The things we'd do to see her face, if even for a minute more.\n\nAnyway. I hope this means something to someone else. It has been terribly hard to write, and there's a lot of stuff in here that //means// something, but might not mean anything to someone else. \n\nThank you for reading it.\n\n-----\n\n= **Image Credits**\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wtc_model_at_skyscraper_museum.jpg\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sonoma_County_shoreline_01.jpg\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Venous_and_arterial_blood_rotated_and_cropped.jpg\nson.jpg is from Balthazaar\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnolia_acuminata-_old_tree_in_Irwin_Park,_New_Canaan,CT,USA.jpg\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Heart_MRI.gif\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pale_treeline_(Unsplash).jpg\n\nAll image edits were made by me, djkaktus.\n\nAlso, shoutout to [https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/jaonhax:obfuscator-demos-and-source jaonhax for the diggity dank obfuscator used in this article!] Also thanks to Woed for a rework to it for my purposes because I'm an incompetent.\n]]\n[[module CSS]]\nsup { \nvertical-align: top; position: relative; top: -0.5em; \n}\n:root{ \n--cutColour: #fafafa;\n--barColour: #590505;\n}\n.translation_block{\ndisplay:none;}\n\n#page-content .info-container {\n    --link-color: rgb(var(--swatch-text-general));\n}\n\n#page-content .info-container .translation_block {\n    display: none;\n}\n\n#page-content .info-container .collapsible-block-link,\n#page-content .info-container:hover .collapsible-block-link {\n    line-height: 1.6em;\n}\n\n#page-content .info-container .collapsible-block-folded,\n#page-content .info-container .collapsible-block-unfolded-link {\n    display: grid;\n}\n\n#page-content .info-container .collapsible-block-folded .collapsible-block-link,\n#page-content .info-container .collapsible-block-link {\n    -webkit-mask: unset;\n            mask: unset;\n    background: transparent;\n    grid-column: 1;\n    grid-row: 1;\n    opacity: 0;\n}\n\n#page-content .info-container .collapsible-block-folded::before,\n#page-content .info-container .collapsible-block-unfolded-link::before {\n    --wght: 800;\n    content: \"djkaktus\";\n    color: #FFFFFF;\n    font-family: Inter, Arimo, Verdana, Geneva, \"Helvetica Neue\", \"Helvetica\", Arial, sans-serif;;\n    display: block;\n    pointer-events: none;\n    grid-column: 1;\n    grid-row: 1;\n}\n\n.pulsate {\n    -webkit-animation: pulsate 1s linear;\n    -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite; \n}\n@-webkit-keyframes pulsate {\n  0% {\n    opacity:1;\n  }\n  25% {\n    opacity:.20;\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity:.9;\n  }\n  70% {\n    opacity:.05;\n  }\n  85% {\n    opacity:.05;\n  }\n}\n[[/module]]\n[[include theme:black-highlighter-theme]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:scp-offices-theme]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:acs-animation]]\n[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[image warning.png]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number=5935\n|clearance=5\n|container-class=esoteric\n|secondary-class=thaumiel\n|secondary-icon=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/component:anomaly-class-bar/thaumiel-icon.svg\n|disruption-class=amida\n|risk-class=critical\n]]\n\n-----\n\n[[include component:image-block name=header.png|align=center|width=100%|caption=SCP-5935.]]\n\n-----\n\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Assigned Site**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Site Director**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Research Head**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Assigned Task Force**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]REDACTED[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]REDACTED[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]REDACTED[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]REDACTED[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n-----\n\n**Cognitohazard Wa3/rning:** For the safety of all persons accessing this document, certain names have been reclaimed. These names are no longer accessible.\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Access to Point Aleph is restricted to members of the SCP Foundation Overseer Council. Access restriction is to be maintained remotely by Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 \"Red Right Hand\". Under absolutely no circumstances is any person to access SCP-5935 without authorization. Persons attempting to cross Point Aleph without authorization are to be destroyed on-sight. \n\nSCP-5935-1 is currently contained within SCP-5935. No other containment procedures are necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5935 is an extradimensional location within a roughly 0.23km x 0.31km area at a point in the southern ocean, classified as Point Aleph. The interior dimension of SCP-5935 massively exceeds the exterior. An accurate measure of the area is nearly impossible to determine. The existence of the anomaly is nearly impossible to determine. The space is inaccessible by sea. The ocean surrounding SCP-5935 is constantly enshrouded by a thick fog that obscures vision of the interior of the space past the boundary line.\n\nWithin SCP-5935 is a single large, generally flat landmass. The landmass is the site of Pandaemonium, a megacity that covers the entirety of the island.\n\nPandaemonium is composed of many hundreds of millions of identical skyscrapers. Each individual skyscraper is roughly 430m tall, with supertowers exceeding 1.12km. The total population of Pandaemonium is unknown, and irrelevant.\n\nThe intended purpose of Pandaemonium is to contain SCP-5935-1.\n\nSCP-5935-1 is an entity contained within Pandaemonium.[[footnote]]Don't touch that dial now.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Addendum 5935.1:** Collected Information\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Journal Entry #1\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n \n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[html]]\n<h1>\n  <center>\n    <div class=\"text\"></div>\n  </center>\n</h1>\n<style>\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Basic|IBM+Plex+Mono:400,700');\n\n.text {\n  color:rgb(25, 20, 16);;\n  font-weight:500;\n  font-size:18px;\n  font-family: \"IBM Plex Mono\", monospace;\n}\n</style>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nobfu_data = {\n    \"delay\":10,\n    \"start_time\":80,\n    \"end_time\":80,\n    \"disp_time\":2000,\n    \"loop\":false,\n    \"obfu_chars\":\"123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@?#$%^&*()\",\n    \"phrases\":[\n        'The system has encountered an unexpected error',\n        'Character \"USER_IDENTIFY\" is missing',\n        'Attempting to load from memory...',\n        'RUNTIME_ERROR',\n        'Excerpt from the Journal of [DATA EXPUNGED], Overseer of the SCP Foundation'\n]\n  }\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5466/obfuscator.js\"></script>\n[[/html]]\n\n-----\nWe buried Jacob beneath the old tree at the Michigan house, where we lived when he was little. He would swing on the rope from that tree for hours and hours, until he got so high that his mother would send me out to call him down. The sound of his laughter is like a song, half remembered from long ago. Now it's gone. Now he's gone.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=grave.png|align=right|width=35%|caption=The place we buried Jacob.]]\n\nWe had a simple service. Mann was there as he had been all along, to make him comfortable at the end. Two and Nine came, which brought Elisa some small relief. The Factotum called Solemn and three members of Red Right Hand were there, as well. They helped me dig the hole where we could place his body. I carried him into the Earth myself and laid him there, under the blanket he had held onto so tight. He was so small, I was worried he'd fall through the spaces in my arms.\n\nWe sat beneath the tree for hours after everybody left. I don't think we have any words left to say. These last five years we've spent everything we had, all of the resources we have left, just to hear our child laugh one more day. The last day has come and gone, and now the silence is suffocating.\n\nHow do you pick up the remnants of a life that was only held together by a single soul once it's gone? The unfairness of it has put me in such a dark place I cannot bear to think about it for too long for fear of losing a grip on my sanity. They tell me that I do not need to worry about coming back to work soon, but I cannot even begin to think about doing anything else at all, ever. The greatest joy in my life was Jacob, and that joy has been seized from me and broken. Nothing else of me remains.\n\nAnd then they come to say their kind words and leave their empty remarks at our door, but I know what lies behind their condolences. Scorn - or worse, two-faced pity. Duplicitous self-righteousness. The sickly proud swell of \"I told you so\", as if Jacob was nothing more than a point for them to prove. They mask their vitriol and distaste with a spectrum of dull pleasantries. I am reminded of what Gibran wrote:\n\n//I have seen a face with a thousand countenances, and a face that was but a single countenance as if held in a mould.//\n\nBut there is nothing left to do. Nothing left to feel. We went back inside without a word, ate a meager meal without a word, and fell asleep in different beds without a word. There is nothing left to do.\n\nI miss my son. I miss my boy.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Journal Entry #2\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n \n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\nlast night i had a dream. i was at a dinner hosted by a close friend from my childhood who i have not seen in many years and whose face i did not recognize, though i did recognize his voice. he was laughing at the end of a long table and the air was filled with the sound of feasting, but i slowly recognized that the table was empty save he and i and the room had grown silent. he was staring at me from the far end of the table. when i looked back, he was beside me.\n\nhis face was round - too round, unnaturally so. it rippled on the edges like it was made of a fabric in the wind, and his eyes were like dots of color suspended from wire somewhere behind his skull, as if he was 2 dimensional. he sat staring at me for some time, and then said \"there is not a way out of where you are, only a way in\". then he pulled the facade of his face away and i saw mann's face instead, with the same suspended eyes. he said \"there is nothing to be done\" and then his face was gone as well, replaced with the face of director light.\n\ni saw then flashing before me faces - everyone i've known, everyone id ever seen. all of them rippling and coiling on the edges, the eyes swinging behind the flapping skin, now glowing like orange cinders at the edge of a fire. i saw others too - the faces of men and women ive never met, but whose names i knew. the faces of those long dead. the faces of those yet to come.\n\nthen i saw, entering the room, another figure. a man? or maybe a woman - their face i could not see. they stood at the edge of the table, a hand placed upon it, staring at the figure beside me. they did not seem to recognize me but their sight was fixated on the creature. i looked back at it and then saw the face of jacob, as he was the day i laid him in the earth. gaunt, chalky and bloated from the medication and the preservatives. his jaw moved as if to speak but his lips could not come together, and bile began to seep from his open mouth. the cinders of his eyes burned brighter and began to swing faster and faster, like the arm of a metronome, in orbits impossibly large behind the veneer of my son. \n\ni heard a word then, spoken with my boy's voice but soft and horrifically echoed across the chamber. in my waking i cannot remember it, but i feel even now its impression on my entire being. at this word, the figure beside me appeared behind it, and then both they and the creature with the swinging eyes vanished into smoke. i saw the room around me come undone, walls falling into floors and the ceiling spiraling up into the haze above me. i felt the sensation of falling, and then weightlessness, and then impact.\n\ni stood at the end of a long street, lined with mirrors as far as i could see. far away, too far i know for me to have seen him now but could perceive perfectly there, was the creature with the fluttering face. the face it wore was one i recognized but had never seen. familiar and intimate. the glistening eyes began to swing, and i woke up.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Journal Entry #3\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n \n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\nElisa did not get out of bed again today.

Always I see the fluttering face and the swinging eyes in the dark of my dreams. sometimes in silence, sometimes it will say the //word//.\n\nShe said little. I know what she thinks, yet I cannot help but wonder. Another Overseer, before he died, always said, \"skepticism is the tool of those who don't know better.\" Who could possibly know better than we? She asked me if it feels like I am being affected by something. //Yes,// I could tell her. //Losing my son.//\n\nShe is trying. We are all trying.

I know I cannot put to rest these nightmares until I do so.\n\nI have sent Elisa away to stay with Nine; she has not yet awoken from the stupor of her grief. I feared I might be forever trapped there with her until I saw this __ONE THING__. It is burned into my mind like a star compressed to a point and held in front of my eyes, searing through the skull as if it is the only thing left in the world. Nine was kind to take her away, and perhaps it is because of her own loss that she understands. Does she know what I intend to do? Would she try to stop me?\n\nIt would not matter.

It was the last trip we took together before he was born, and we spent most of our time in each other's company, in Alfonse's manse. Thinking of it now, I believe it was the first time off I'd had in more than a year. It felt like it could have been a dozen. \n\nI'm in the den, and there's snow falling outside. The room is lit by the fire in the hearth. Elisa is not with me, and I feel unease. There's something moving on the ceiling but I can't see it through the dark - or maybe I don't look up at all. I have something in my hand, [[[SCP-184|something heavy]]].  \n\nSomeone else in the room says something to me, and it's not until that moment I realize that I'm not alone. They ask me my name, and I tell them. //No,// they say, //what is your name.// I don't answer. I don't know how to answer. I don't remember it, or if I could remember it, the words are gone. After a moment, I give another name. Mann's name. They shake their head. //Your name//.\n\nI am embarrassed, and give another. They repeat, again and again, and every time I give another name. Elias Shaw. Skitter Marshall. Michelangelo Kervier. Tilda Moose. Arvind Desai. Gregory Vandivier. Troy Lament. Jacob. The figure pauses at the last name, considering it. //No,// it says, //but close enough.//\n\nI'm suddenly aware of another presence. I stumble backwards, my steps long and horrible, working my way through the maze of hallways, doorways that lead to room full of doorways, a spiraling labyrinth of misdirection. I hear Elisa scream. I scream. Something behind me screams with me.\n\nThe last door opens and I'm in the room where Jacob died. Elisa is laying on the ground, her body splayed like a fallen marionette and her stomach torn open across the middle. Blood pools in the cavity and cascades over the side. The air becomes thick and my eyes water. //In//, the voice says. //The only way to go is in.//\n\nI fall to my hands and knees and crawl forwards. I do not know if I weep. Elisa's face is turned away from me. I put my hands on either side of her ruptured belly and push my face into the blood. My body sinks into hers and I am falling. \n\nI don't know how long I am falling for. The air is thick with misery. I see nothing but red and hear nothing but a beating heart, my own or another. The figure is with me. //Your name//, it says, but I cannot speak. I open my mouth to try and blood fills my throat, then my lungs. I try to scream out. Throbbing silence answers.\n\nThen, I awaken. I am standing at the edge of a treeline, one I recognize too well. Behind me is the **##green|land of wild and whispers##**, a thousand fearful eyes peering out from the safety of the dark. Something flutters at the corner of my vision, and I see a face floating by, carried on the wind. Elisa's dead eyes look past me as it catches an updraft and disappears. I look up. \n\nThe sky is full of faces, papery and soft, wordlessly dancing on zephyrs. One comes near me and I brush it away, and see the face of my father watching, unmoving, driven only by the breeze. I look down. There is a long dirt road leading down into a valley, down where **##540600|it##** is. \n\nBehind me are the trees. Above me are the faces.\n\nAnd in front of me is...\n[[=]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\nthe path I had to walk\n\nthe place I had to stand\n\nthe words I had to say\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"pulsate\"]]\n[[size 140%]]**##540600|the thing I had to do.##**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-left: 1px solid #540600; border-right: 1px solid #540600;\"]]\n[[image BREAK.png]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include component:coltop show=+ Addendum 5935.??

Past the **##green|long winding path##**?\n\n(//Silence//)\n\n**O5-█:** Answer her.\n\n(//Silence//)\n\n**##red|O5-█:##** There was a hill, and at its crest the path ended. Below me was an idea, something that even our forebears had forgotten. A place where the sinking guilt of loss and despair has congealed, and in that place there is a **##540600|question##**.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[=]]\nSometimes I think I'm still standing there, looking at it.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nI do not remember how it was asked, or whether or not there was a voice that spoke to me. The question was innate to that place, something that did not need words - only an answer. There were three pieces, and for each a price to pay. Flesh. Joy. **##540600|Something worse##**.\n\nThere were moments where I thought I had glimpsed it, like seeing a corpse through black smoke and fire. A nameless dead at the center of the darkness. I've seen horrors, and I know truths about this world that would turn mortal men to wraiths, fleeing on the wind from the quiet reality we hold at bay. But this question, this heart of hatred, could not be contained with walls and steel. There is not a box in all of creation for it.\n\nWe had presumed that when those who lost their names disappeared into the **##green|quiet forest##** they would find themselves alone there. //Foolish//. When fire and hubris comes for us and we must disappear into our walled prisons for safety, would they be empty? No. The **##green|place beyond the old well##** was not built for them - they simply had no other options. So they ran to the one place they had left - a place where **##540600|the question lingers##**.\n\n**##green|Those woods##** were made by them for their own protection - a maze that only they would know, and one that **##540600|that thing that lies beyond the forest##** would not be able to find a way through. I found it by accident. I went there looking for Jacob's name because I believed if I found it I could have him back. I could take him home, sit beneath the old tree and laugh and watch him learn and grow like we had always planned. I learned quickly that his name was not there, but in my desperation to escape I found the other road, the one that leads to the treeline at the top of the hill.\n\nI had to make sacrifices. The thing I found there is old, older than the nameless wanderers who have made their home in the **##green|grove without end##**. Older than the Earth. Older than the stars in the sky. But within it I saw an opportunity. A chance to make my son whole again. There would be cost, but what father would hesitate to lay his life down for his son? So I did **##540600|the thing I had to do##**, and when I awoke I was there with Jacob again. My son was alive. He had come back to me and we were together.\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n**##red|O5-█:##** Any of you who says they would not make terrible sacrifices of themselves for those things they love in this life are //liars//.\n\n**##gold|O5-█:##** It does not matter.

Jesus and Vishnu and the lot. Why?\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]** \nWe have a skewed perception of what constitutes the divine, I think. Outsiders would tell you it's something sufficiently powerful, or of some religious significance. Some of our own might tell you it has to do with where an entity gets its power, or if it can even be called an entity at all.\n[[/>]]\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nI'm not sure what you mean.\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]** \nWhen we talk about gods in the Foundation, we talk about the Broken God, or the God of Flesh, or the God of Dreams. Gods of //ideas//, these aspects of one thing or another. The Broken God is a god of Order, the Flesh God is a god of Fertility, and so on. Then there are creator gods, and gods of death. So on and so forth, an endless parade of divinity.\n\nBut there are beings that existed long before the First Man broke bread with the new gods in his golden city. Beings that formed before the universe had shape, beings perhaps even older than that. Calling them \"entities\" would misrepresent them - they don't //exist// like you and I do. They're not real. They are the questions whose answers sprung forth into light and life. The formless echo of a voice that never existed. \n[[/>]]\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nAn echo.\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]** \nThey are questions. When they were answered, they stopped existing. All of them, one by one, disappeared into irrelevance once their answer was made proof.\n[[/>]]\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nWhat was it, then? What was in that place?\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]** \nA question that should have never been asked. Hidden away and lost, perhaps by design or perhaps by sheer luck. A question that had been forgotten, until the day a desperate man got lost in **##green|that still forest##** and found it. The fae didn't put it there. They have likely forgotten it was ever there - forgotten **##540600|what had to be done to keep them safe##**.\n[[/>]]\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nHow do you claim to know so much about this?\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nThere's a dark room in a site without a designation where a stone tomb rests beneath a mile of rock and iron. In that tomb is a creature, something that was perhaps once beautiful and regal but is reduced to little more than the space in which it exists, if that. They thought they were clever, burying it like they did. But I know the way in. I found the way down to where the Last King of Night lies sleeping, and I //listened//. He does not speak, but he will tell you things. That's how I know. \n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n//Silence.//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nI thought that might drive you away. Maybe you're beginning to figure it out now, like I did. Maybe you're seeing a line drawn between two points, and the space where they have yet to meet blisters your mind like hot metal on flesh. He told me where it was, and that's why I went that day, to watch and see. I needed to know. He was so close to what he was looking for, if he had just stayed on his path he might have made it. He might have gotten his son back. But that path did not lead to where I needed him to go, so I too gave something up. I gave up something of yours, as well. You won't need it. Not anymore. And it was //worth it//. \n\nI do wonder if he even gave it a second thought. I wonder if he took a moment to try and comprehend what he'd done. Maybe it was that distraction that allowed him to survive at all. He thought he was making a deal with a dead fae god in exchange for a soul. Poor idiot. You can't trade for something that no longer exists. All that sacrifice, and he received **##540600|something else entirely##**.\n\nI wonder if he's realized it yet. \n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 5935.9:** Additional Collected Information\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Journal Entry #9\" hide=\"- Always\"]]\n \n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\nJacob\n\nJacob, can you hear me?\n\nWhere have you gone?\n\nWhere is the warmth of your body?\n\nWhere is the beating of your heart?\n\nThe Council has reached a majority. My vote can no longer keep you safe. What will they do to you?\n\nThey say blades cannot pierce you and your body rejects poison. You have become so strong. But there are other machinations the Council wields that are outside of even my eyes. Will they turn their engines of change onto you? Will they soak the ground again in your blood?\n\nI'm alone now, sitting in the dark. But I'm comforted by the memories - our memories. Your mother and I, we knew what would be said if we tried to have a child. Progeny among the members of the Council are rare, and those who have children are looked down upon as liabilities. They fear that a child would cloud an Overseer's judgment, make them susceptible to blackmail, fear, and threats. \n\nI loved your mother more than anything in the world, and each passing day saw the light of what could have been - what she had dreamed of once, pass from her eyes. The day you were born, she was reborn as well. All of her fire and joy and radiance returned all at once as she held you in her arms, shaking from her tears.\n\nIn those early days, in the quiet hours when your mother would sleep and I would hold you near me by the fire, I promised you I would give you everything you ever wanted. I would build you a city on a hill, shining and beautiful, a reflection of the love we had for you. A lifetime of desire made manifest in your perfect heart. As you wasted away, those dreams and promises crumbled like sand between my fingers until they were gone.\n\nBut now you're //here//, and all that separates us is the authority of the Council. Damn them. They can hide in their fortress and plug their ears but if they won't choose to listen then I will make them. I will tear down the walls of their command and prove to them that they are wrong, and then we will be together again. You, me, and your mother.\n\nI'm coming tonight, Jacob. I'll take you away, you and your mother, and build a shining city just for you. Your mother is with me. Tonight we will be together. You are coming for me. I know it.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 5935.10:** Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 Emergency Dispat//.2?\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Access Dispatch File\" hide=\"- Together\"]]\n \n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n**[0104HRS LOCAL]** SUBJECT SCP-5935-1 REMOVED FROM EUCLID-CLASS CONTAINMENT VESSEL BY OVERSEER ORDER.

There are just so many, it would be easy for someone to get lost in here.\n[[/>]]\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Elisa**\nWhat did you just say?\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nHmm? Oh, just that the city is bigger than I could've ever hoped for. It truly is our shining city. Rows and rows and rows, it goes on forever.\n[[/>]]\n\n//Jacob enters the room.//\n\n[[=]]\n**Jacob**\nDad. Something is wrong.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nWhat's wrong, son? You sound scared.\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Jacob**\nCan you come look at this with me?\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nSure. Elisa, I'll be back shortly.\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Jacob**\nWho are you talking to?\n[[/=]]\n\n//Silence.//\n\n[[>]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\nAh. Right. Let's go.\n[[/>]]\n\nWe leave our apartment, out into the long hallway that runs down the length of the building. We take the stairs - the elevators are typically busy this time of day. We greet the neighbors as we pass, and they smile and wave back. \n\nThe streets bustle with activity. People passing, talking with each other, selling their wares. Above us are the skyscrapers, our homes and workplaces, and above them is the sun and sky. Jacob looks down the long street outside of our building. He squints against the glare.\n\n\"How big is Pandaemonium, dad?\"\n\nI think for a moment. \"Big. Bigger than we'll ever see, but plenty of cities are big.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but if you had to put a //number// on it. How many days would it take to walk across it?\"\n\nI shrug. \"I don't know. I haven't tried!\"\n\nIt is in this moment that I notice that the people around us have stopped moving. Their faces frozen in place, smiles and eyes unmoving. I look across them, trying to catch a gaze, but only one meets me. A pair of glowing amber orbs.\n\n\"You lied to me,\" Jacob says. His voice is the same childish lilt I had grown to love, but behind the words is menace, and uncertainty. Something has frightened him.\n\n\"That's not a lie,\" I say. \"I've never tried. You would've known if I had - I might have been walking forever.\"\n\n\"//Quiet,//\" Jacob hisses. \"This is what you //asked// for. You made this place, so of course you would try to do something to it.\" His pace is quickening now, like an animal running through the dark forest, fleeing from something it cannot see. \"You brought something in here. Something that wasn't allowed. You've tricked me.\"\n\nI shrug. \"I don't know what you're talking about. Everything here was here when we arrived.\"\n\nHe snaps towards me. \"//Liar.// There's something else here. I felt something earlier. Where is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, Jacob. You know just as well as I do that I couldn't have brought anything in here. It's just us.\"\n\nI am suddenly aware of a hundred thousand faces, each of them passing in a quiet march, none of them turning to look at us. A line of humans, unbound from their humanity, passes between us. I hear the echo of footsteps. Millions of people enter their homes. Billions. The sun begins to set.\n\n\"No, no you couldn't.\" Jacob is panicking. \"But this place is //different,// it- it- it's //growing//. How long did you say? You could walk and walk and never reach the edge? How could you know this? How did you do it?\"\n\nI laugh. I can't help it. Even now, he tries to trick me. I see my own face appear in an instant, the furious amber orbs swinging frantically behind empty sockets. \"//How did you do it?//\"\n\n\"I promised you,\" I say slowly, \"that I would build a shining city for you, my son. A place we could be together, forever. This city, Pandaemonium, this is our city.\"\n\nThe streets are empty, and always have been. A strong wind whips down the paved streets. Above us tower giants, the colossal guardians of this place, silent and unmoving. Across from me is my son, but only in the skin draping over its withered, limp form. This creature opens its mouth, and a choked gasp escapes its lips.\n\n\"//[[[SCP-184|The Architect]]]//,\" Jacob says, his face warping into a grim mockery of another Overseer. \"How did you get it here? You couldn't have left without me knowing, and it wasn't here when I got here, unless...\" The creature screeches. \"//You had it inside you. You brought it **inside you**!//\"\n\n\"A dream,\" I say, \"a dream I had of this place, long before you brought us here. Endless streets, variation on variation - a city that does not end. A place for us to be, forever. It was there in the next dream, as well. And then the next. It has been here for many long years now, building the framework for Pandaemonium.\"\n\nMy son howls. Its body is rendered as something monstrous and uncanny appears from within, a horrifying, clicking beast. I hesitate and flinch, but hold my ground. The worst it can do is kill me. It shrieks and hisses and I see flashing nightmares in the air around it, the torn and twisted bodies of my parents, the crumpled and defeated form of Jacob in the ground, Elisa scattered across the room like a crimson butterfly. I see something else, something I saw down in **##540600|that sullen place##**.\n\n\"In exchange for my name, you gave me what I wanted. A chance to say goodbye.\" Blood rushes between the beast's grinding teeth. New faces appear across its own, desperately searching for something that will affect me. A face that will stay my hand. Elisa. My brother. A former girlfriend. My son. My mother. Friends, colleagues, they flash and shriek and writhe in an agony that does not exist. \"This city is my gift to you. A place for you to live with that name, for as long as you wish. A place where you can't hurt anyone.\"\n\nA moment passes, and then another. At the third, my son lays before me again, crumpled into a heap on the ground. He breathes heavily, and looks up and away, past me, down the long avenue flanked by towers.\n\n\"Where is it?\" it says. Its voice is barely a whisper.\n\nI shake my head. \"Buried. Somewhere beneath here, in a distant memory. Pandaemonium, this city we built together, is built upon itself over and over again. Its foundation is the still living bodies of the hands that built it. It's long gone, buried somewhere beneath ten-thousand years of its own creations.\"\n\nJacob sighs. \"And even if I had it, it wouldn't change anything. It doesn't unmake.\"\n\nI nod.\n\nElisa stands up. She looks at me, and then at the sky. \"How far does it go? How far away is the edge?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It might take a thousand years to cross. Maybe a hundred thousand. By the time you have found your way out of Pandaemonium, you will have exhausted the name I gave you and will be reduced to what you really are - an envious, hateful vacuum. A spiteful ghost. Something that I should have left in the dark.\"\n\n\"But,\" I continue, \"we will be together. Always we two. You can spend lifetimes out there, searching for the edge of a city that grows larger every day, or you can stay here with me.\"\n\nJacob looks at me. The amber orbs are there, but they swing less quickly. I see something in its gaze. Is it fear? Anger? Sadness?\n\n\"I festered in the darkness of my own non-existence for endless hours,\" it says, hate dripping off its writhing tongue. \"It is not vapid desire that drives me, but my own design. I will walk for a //trillion years// if I must, or more, and when I am free from this prison I will share this blood with every being that draws breath and take back those names that were once part of me. Then,\" it inhales sharply, \"I will be whole.\"\n\nIt turns to walk, but hesitates. It looks at me, and for a moment I can see something else within it, something apart from the malice.\n\n\"And when I have reclaimed them,\" it says softly, \"and when this world reaches its closing, I will come back here. Then, we will be together.\"\n\nMoments later it is gone, down the street and into the dark labyrinth of endless monoliths. I watch until it disappears into the night. The wind still blows. \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nI go back to our apartment. Around me, in man-sized containers that litter each new structure sleep the soulless bodies of my neighbors, Pandaemonium's citizenry. An endless mass of faces that the Doppelganger cannot seize. [[[SCP-2000|They never belonged to it]]].\n\nI sit alone in my empty apartment, nameless and accursed. I hear the distant laughter of my wife and my son, and I smile. \n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n//Jacob, come inside.//\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n//It's almost time for bed.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@ \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ REVISED ENTRY\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n**Item #:** SCP-5935\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5935 is contained in a secure medical ward at Site-17.
