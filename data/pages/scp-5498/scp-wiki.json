SCP-5498 was capable of observing and transmitting both visual and audible data to PoI-0971 (\"Masego Anavrin\"). \n\n**Discovery**\n\nSCP-5498 was discovered during a raid on an organization known as the Fifth Commune in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. At the time, SCP-5498 resided within Himani Patel's eye sockets[[footnote]]Curiously, Himani Patel did not have any public or private records.[[/footnote]]. Patel was a latent reality bender with strong connections to the Fifth Commune. It is speculated that she had intimate relationships with the Fifth Commune's leading figures, including PoI-0971. According to Foundation agents within the Fifth Commune, Patel was involved in an occult ritual at the time of the raid[[footnote]]Several thaumaturgic symbols of unknown origin and intent were tattooed on Patel's back. She also had deep lacerations across both of her wrists and ankles, which suggest attempted exsanguination.[[/footnote]].\n\nThe raid inadvertently resulted in the destruction of the Fifth Commune, and several of its members and leadership figures were killed. Patel and the other survivors were interrogated and administered Type D amnestics. Patel, however, proved resistant to the amnestic treatment and was taken to Site-83 for further examination and medical treatment. SCP-5498 was discovered by Dr. Andrews following an ocular examination. \n\nPatel, who was unaware of these symbols, speculated that PoI-0971 might have been involved. By her account, PoI-0971 exhibited predatory behavior toward her during their time within the Fifth Commune[[footnote]]Including but not limited to; sending unsolicited gifts, love letters written on flower petals, staring at her for extended periods of time, photographing her while unconscious, and consuming her hair.[[/footnote]]. Patel agreed to have SCP-5498 removed under the condition that the Foundation synthesize new eyes for her. Her request was denied, and SCP-5498 was removed after heavy sedation.\n\nA comprehensive list of letters sent by PoI-0971 to Himani Patel prior to their containment can be found below.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview PoI-0971\" hide=\"Close File\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nOver the course of twenty days PoI-0971 made several unsuccessful attempts at breaching Site-83. It was hypothesized that he was attempting to abduct Himoni Patel for currently unknown reasons.\n\nOn February 10^^th^^, 2024, PoI-0971 managed to successfully enter Site-83 and eluded Foundation security for forty minutes before being apprehended just outside of Patel's containment suite. He was brought to Site-83's interrogation chamber and questioned by Dr. Andrews. \n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Andrews\n\n**Interviewed:** PoI-0971\n\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n**Andrews:** State your name for the record, please.\n\n**PoI-0971:** Does that really matter?\n\n**Andrews:** Answer the question, then we can continue.\n\n**PoI-0971:** Masego Anarvin, husband to Himani Anarvin. I'd like to see her, before you wipe my mind that is.\n\n**Andrews:** I'm afraid that won't be possible.\n\n**PoI-0971:** Why? Why not?\n\n**Andrews:** We have reason to believe that you are directly responsible for the creation of SCP-5498. \n\n**PoI-0971:** I was just looking out for my wife. Can't blame a husband for being concerned, can you? Just let me see her, I need to know if she's alright. The ritual could have been painful.\n\n**Andrews:** I think we both know that would be detrimental to Himani's mental health, wouldn't you agree?\n\n**PoI-0971:** No, no. I think a visit would be //extremely// helpful. You're keeping her somewhere dark, and quiet. And she's all alone. She's terrified... You have to take me to her. Now.\n\n**Andrews:** You are in no position to make demands, sir. We've removed SCP-5498 from Himani. You can't spy on her.\n\n**PoI-0971:** You did... what?\n\n**Andrews:** We've worked out how you managed to discover this location, but we haven't figured out why you've taken such an interest in Himani Patel. Can you elaborate?\n\n**PoI-0971:** I told you, she's my wife. My wife whom you've kidnapped and blinded for no goddamn reason!\n\n**Andrews:** Our records indicate that-\n\n**PoI-0971:** Your records are outdated. \n\n**Andrews:** I sincerely doubt that.\n\n**PoI-0971:** Are you calling me a liar?\n\n**Andrews:** I would never insinuate that, Mr. Anarvin.\n\n**PoI-0971:** Then what are you trying to say?\n\n**Andrews:** I was inquiring about your relationship with Himani.\n\n**PoI-0971:** Stop calling her that.\n\n**Andrews:** I'm sorry, I don't understand. Stop calling her what?\n\n**PoI-0971:** \"Himani\". It's Mrs. Anarvin to you. She's my wife. MINE. Don't talk about her like you know her. You don't know shit about her. You weren't a part of the Commune. You didn't watch over her when she went shopping with her friends or tried on clothes in the fitting room at Walmart. You weren't there for anything, never protected her, never saved her. Don't speak like you did.\n\n**Andrews:** My apologies. \n\n**PoI-0971:** It's fine, it's just... Himani's my everything. She grounds me, and I keep her out of trouble. \n\n**Andrews:** So you were like a guardian of sorts?\n\n**PoI-0971:** I shield her from everything. I know she appreciates it; the few times she caught me doing my job she smiled and waved at me. That's how she lets me know she loves me. ( //He pauses// ). She's naive. You've seen it for yourself I'm sure. She's nice. Too nice. A lot of guys think she's flirting with them. \n\n**Andrews:** What do you do to those men?\n\n**PoI-0971:** I saved her. I'm not a bad person.\n\n**Andrews:** What did you do?\n\n( //PoI-0971 scratches the back of his head and looks down.// ) \n\n**PoI-0971:** Okay look, I never killed anyone. But they... ( //He laughs// ) The Commune put themselves in that situation, ya know? It's //their// fault they wound up like that. \n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The 14/02/24 Incident\" hide=\"Close\"]]\nPoI-0971 began experiencing emotional distress in his containment cell on February 14th, 2024. The following security footage was recovered after the incident:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**13:02:** PoI-0971 is sitting in his cell.\n\n**13:05:** There is a slight tremor. PoI-0971 notices this but dismisses it.\n\n**13:06:** There is a second tremor. PoI-0971 gets up and requests to be let out.\n\n**13:08:** Cracks appear in the east-facing wall. \n\n**13:13:** An envelope manifests in between the cracks. PoI-0971 investigates.\n\n**13:15:** PoI-0971 opens the envelope and extracts a sheet of paper, presumably a letter. He reads it.\n\n**13:16:** After reading the letter, PoI-0971 exhibits extreme emotional distress and bangs on the containment chamber door repeatedly. \n\n**13:17:** A containment breach alarm is heard. \n\n**13:18:** A hand manifests from the floor and grips the east-facing wall. The hand ascends.\n\n**13:20:** Himani Patel's head emerges from the hole in the floor. She continues using the wall to ascend.\n\n**13:21:** PoI-0971 retreats from the containment chamber door, facing Patel. Patel approaches him.\n\n**13:22:** Patel vocalizes something that causes PoI-0971 to cover his eyes. He sits on the ground in the fetal position.\n\n**13:21:** Tentacle-like appendages emerge from Patel's back and attack PoI-0971 via bludgeoning. Blood is splattered against the walls and floor. \n\n**13:25:** PoI-0971 ceases to move. Patel extracts his eyes and heart before consuming them. \n\n**13:26:** Patel exits through the cracks in the wall. \n[[/div]]\n\nThe following is the contents of the letter recovered from the containment chamber:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nI know you've been watching me, Masego. You had no idea what I was, or else why would you have starved me for so long? It's a misunderstanding that could have been fixed if you just talked to me, sweety.\n\nBut I forgive you. I forgive you because I love you. \n\nAnd I love you to death.\n[[/div]]\n\nHimani Patel's location is currently unknown.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Letters found in Himani Patel's containment suite\" hide=\"Close File\"]]\nThe following is a comprehensive list of letters from PoI-0971 that Himani Patel relinquished upon her arrival in Foundation custody. \n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nI've seen you almost every day at the Colonial[[footnote]]A popular eating establishment in Lyndhurst.[[/footnote]] and I wonder to myself \"How can I approach you?\". Every time I think about doing so, I am overcome with fear and anxiety. You looked so beautiful when you came into our dimension. I'll never understand why you hide those tattoos on your back. \n\nMy shyness gets the better of me, you understand. Sometimes I sit in the booth behind you, thinking about what to say. Your hair smells so nice, and it distracts me a lot of the time. God, I wish I could talk to you. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nI saw the way you tore that policeman apart when he **wrongfully** gave you a parking ticket yesterday. Took him into an alley where no one would see. No one, but me that is. Were you putting on a show? I don't know what you did to him, but the mess you left behind... He must have been quite the asshole. I would never treat you that way.\n\nYou walked outta there with that smile on your face. Do you think that your power gives you security? \n\nThere was a man who was coming to approach you afterward. You didn't have time to change into new clothes yet, and the illusion spell covering up the body hadn't been fully cast yet. I saw you panic, Himani, and I did what any good boyfriend would do. \n\nYou don't have to worry about that guy anymore.\n\nP.S. You really shouldn't shower with that Old Spice stuff. It's bad for your skin.\nP.P.S. I've asked around and did some research. The higher pressure settings in the shower work better, I hear.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nReverend Koin tells us that we should act like gods and take what we want. If only I had the courage to take you.\n\nThat girl isn't right for you. I've seen the way she looks into your eyes. There's nothing there but insanity. She stares at you when you aren't looking. I've seen it in your peripherals. She's nothing more than a predator. \n\nMy wife deserves better. You need me.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nWhy are you doing this to me? Are you mad about that rando? Get over yourself, I'm trying to help you!\n\nWhat's //Elizabeth// got that I don't, huh? The Commune is dead now. We're all on the same level.\n\nShe cheats on you, you know, with Brandon and Ginger. When you go to work, or on your walks, she'll call them up and they'll be at the house within the hour. I've seen them fuck. On --your-- our bed. I've seen that bitch use your shower settings.\n\nI can make you happy, Himani. Give me a chance.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nI went to your apartment while you were at work. Took the liberty to clean up the //huge// mess you left behind, rid of the arms and legs, and cleaned up all the blood. Brandon and Ginger are... well, they aren't competing for your love anymore. \n\nThe police shouldn't occupy you with their stupid questions now, my love.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nI realized the decision must have been hard on you. That's why I made it for you, as a good husband should.\n\nI love you, Himani Patel.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nWhy haven't you responded to my letters, Himani? Why are you crying? Am I too far away? Are you scared to show me what you really are? I can handle it. I'll love you no matter what.\n\nYou've captured my eyes, and taken my heart. I belong to you, now and forever.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5497]]] | SCP-5498 | [[[SCP-5499]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
