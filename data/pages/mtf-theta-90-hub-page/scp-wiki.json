But with that said, MTF Theta-90 (\"Angle Grinders\") is a Foundation Mobile Task Force trained to operate in areas that have anomalous geometry. When the angles are all wrong, when the space is non-Euclidean, or when the topology isn't what it should be, Theta-90 are the ones you call.\n\nMTF Theta-90 was originally a one-off for [[[SCP-1707]]]. They've come quite a long way since then.\n\n+ [[[mtf-theta-90-character-profiles|Character Roster (with portraits!) now up - click here!]]]\n----\n\n[[=]]\n++ Tales\n[[/=]]\n\n//None of the Theta-90 tales are very long. Think of them as a series of vignettes that can be read together or independently. There is an overarching narrative, but that's not required to enjoy any individual tale.//\n _\n\n__**Chapter One: Indoctrination**__\n\n**//0. [[[Sunday, 0600, Mobile Task Force Central Training Facility|Mobile Task Force Basic School: Induction Remarks]]]**\nA transcript of a short talk given by Dimaccio to brand-new MTF operatives. Jane Weiss' first appearance in-universe.//\n\n**1. [[[Wednesday, 3pm, The Office of Paul Dimaccio]]]**\n//Dimaccio and Weiss have their first one-on-one... with an unexpected guest.//\n\n**2. [[[Monday, 6am, Escherville Facility Two]]]**\n//Weiss goes on one of her first training exercises, and learns the difference between anti-memetics and anti-emetics. The hard way.//\n\n**3. [[[friday-2200-paul-dimaccios-personal-quarters | Friday, 2200, Paul Dimaccio's Personal Quarters]]]**\n//Sometimes, it's lonely at the top.//\n\n**4. [[[Running Out]]]**\n//A set of connected mini-vignettes on the theme of running, closing out Volume One.//\n _\n\n__**Chapter Two: You Can't Go Home Again**__\n\n**5. [[[Four Years Later]]]**\n//Two years after Jane Weiss joined MTF Theta-90, a basic area extraction went wrong. And two years after that, we rejoin our crew to see how they're doing.//\n\n**6. [[[mtf-theta-90-turning-points|Turning Points]]]**\n//Picking up immediately after the last tale, we see three different examples of Theta-90 members new and old facing their own very particular points of inflection.//\n\n**7.** //(TBA)//\n\n**8.** //(TBA)//\n\n**9.** //(TBA)//\n\n _\n----\n[[=]]\n++++ SCPs that Employ or Mention MTF Theta-90\n\n[[[SCP-914]]][[footnote]]Experiment Log vol. 11.[[/footnote]]\n[[[SCP-1707]]]\n[[[SCP-2601]]]\n[[[SCP-3307]]]\n[[[SCP-4037]]]\n[[[SCP-4096]]]\n[[[SCP-4104]]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++++ Cameos, jokes and other stuff\n[[/=]]\n[[[mtf-theta-90-character-profiles|MTF Theta-90 Tac Team 10 Roster]]] - presented as a fictional email, this fills the reader in on all the major named characters encountered as of late 2022. Portraits courtesy of the excellent [[user *nihonio]].\n\n[[[Tuesday, 11am, Conference Room Three]]] - this one isn't quite Fully In Canon, but it's fun, so I left it. Thanks to all the SCP Wiki authors who let me use their avatars.\n\n[[[navarro-saves-christmas-for-some-people-he-barely-knows| Navarro Saves Christmas]]], by TwistedGears (Jane Weiss cameo)\n\n[[[SCP-7090]]] features Aluko and Zheng, but isn't strictly speaking a Theta-90 thing.\n\n[[[the-character-assassination-of-site-666-by-theta-90-a-poem|The Character Assassination Of Site-666 By The Cowards MTF Theta-90]]] - a very absurd (and noncanonical!) poem that was my Halloweencon 2022 entry.\n\n[[[Guide Hub]]] - if you were on 19cord Reading Club one winter's evening, well... you know why this is here. If you weren't? It's a damn good refresher about how to write for the Wiki.\n\n----\n _\n _\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Theta90.png\n> **Name:** MTF Theta-90 (\"Angle Grinders\")\n> **Author:** [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/desk-of-junior-designer-s-yvonne\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
