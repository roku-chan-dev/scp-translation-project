Foundation personnel are to continually monitor footage for breach of perimeter. Any personnel who enter an orbital cycle event are to be considered \"lost\".\n\n**Description:** SCP-7218 is a phenomenon that occurs when an individual enters the main showing room of the Hilliard Planetarium and Astronomy Museum in Hilliard, Ohio alone. \n\nThe interior of the room occupies a separate reality to baseline. Upon entering the room, it is still possible for the subject to return to their former reality provided they do not enter an Orbital Cycle. During an Orbital Cycle Event,time passes faster within the alternate reality, with a ratio of one year per hour in baseline reality. \nIn addition, direct contact with subject becomes impossible, with signals being able to be received by those outside the anomaly, but not subjects within, effectively isolating anyone inside. As of now, the only known way to trigger an event is by standing on the speaker's platform inside. \n\nSCP-7218 was discovered after several disappearances of citizens within the area. The Foundation began an investigation using D-Class personnel, which confirmed an anomalous effect, with a 40% return rate. As of 1.5.17, all testing has been stopped. [SEE ADDENDUM-1]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum-1\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n\n\n\n> On 7.10.16, Researcher Madison Turnpike was deployed into SCP-7218 in an attempt to gather data about the interior mechanics. Turnpike underwent psychological and physical evaluations beforehand, and was found to be in acceptable health. Before entering, Turnpike was fitted with standard exploration equipment, including a radio and video monitor attached to her, as well as a location tracking device. At 9:30 AM, EST, Turnpike entered SCP-7218. Communication has become impossible as of 7.23.16. \n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**7.10.16:** \n\n**NOTE:** The following is compiled video footage received by Site 403 Command.  \n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Video begins on the hallway of the planetarium. Main lights have been turned off, though emergency lights have been activated to offer limited visibility. Researcher Sam Leviticus is visible, helping adjust Researcher Turnpike's equipment.//\n \n**COMMAND**: This is Site 403 Director Moira Fersnby, acting as Command. Researcher, can you state your name for me?\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Dr. Madison Turnpike, at your service.  \n\n**COMMAND**: Good. Audio feed seems to be working. \n\n**TURNPIKE**: Great! \n\n**LEVITICUS**: Does that mean she's ready to go?\n\n**COMMAND**: Yes. Proceed through the doors. \n\n//Turnpike turns away from Researcher Leviticus, and takes a moment to breath, before entering the showing room. When the doors shut behind her, the feed experiences a spike in disruption, followed by a five second period of radio silence. The feed shows a large darkened room, with rows of empty seats leading to a domed screen at the front. A black lectern stands in the front. A few dim floor lights line the ramps along the sides.//\n\n**COMMAND**: Dr. Turnpike? Is everything alright?\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Yeah! Sorry, Moira. Just a small cut-out.\n\n**COMMAND**: No worries. Can you describe your surroundings for me? \n\n**TURNPIKE**: Of course. Uh, looks like a planetarium, I guess. Black carpet, lots of seats. A screen, too. \n\n//A pause, as Turnpike looks around.//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: No overhead lights. Don't see a projector either. Dangit. Would've loved to mess around with some anomalous tech. Did you catch that gun thing-y I worked on the other day? Levi says they wanna share the design around with some of the other people in the CDED.[[footnote]] Containment Design and Engineering Department [[/footnote]]\n\n**COMMAND**: Well, that's certainly impressive.\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Yeah, I- actually, I'll save it 'til I'm out. You said there's something here that people have a 60% chance of encountering, right? \n\n**COMMAND**: That was the consensus.\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Well... I'm not really seeing anything. You guys sure this is even the anomaly?\n\n**COMMAND**: Yes. In fact, as of now, the tracking equipment is informing us that your current location is not on Planet Earth.\n\n//A brief pause.//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: ...Well, that's a comfort and a joy. \n\n**COMMAND**: Right.

Use tweezers, don't touch it with your gloves. And make sure the bag is airtight. \n\n//Turnpike uses the scalpel to cut a roughly square-shaped sample from one of the seats. The fabric is dark blue. Samples were never successfully retrieved, but the appearance seems to be velvet.//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Got it.\n\n**MADDIE:** Really? Show me, I want to make sure-\n\n**TURNPIKE:** I've been working here for four years, I can handle this. \n\n**MADDIE**: The bag isn't all the way sealed. \n\n**TURNPIKE:** -I was about to fix that!\n\n**MADDIE**: Moira, I'd like to recommend that we avoid asking the engineering department to help in the future.  \n\n**COMMAND**: Thank you for the input, Simes. Turnpike, keep moving through the rows. Let's limit talking to the task at hand, please.\n\n//Dr. Simes and Dr. Turnpike both apologise semi-intelligibly. Turnpike moving through each row, and stopping periodically to comment on the environment.//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: You wanted me to take down one of the posters as well, right?\n\n**MADDIE**: Yes. Turn the camera toward one of them, so I can see it.\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Here.\n\n//Turnpike points the camera towards a patch of wall with a poster. Size estimate is 2'x1'// \n\n**COMMAND:** Can you describe what you see, please?\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Uh, yeah. It's tan, with a picture on it of a... god, is that an comet or a meteor? It has a caption - \"Halley's Comet. Saturday Only.\" Okay, comet then.\n\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Planetarium_%28AM_6122%29.jpg/399px-Planetarium_%28AM_6122%29.jpg?20191020212227]]\n\n\n**MADDIE**: That wouldn't make sense, given that the comet was last seen in 1986. \n\n**TURNPIKE**, sarcastic: Really? I never would've guessed.\n\n**COMMAND**: Can you remove it?\n\n**TURNPIKE:** Sure. \n\n//Turnpike uses the scalpel to cut away the edges of the poster and carefully attempt to remove it. However, the paper seems stuck to the wall.//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: I think this might rip if I pull any harder. What should I do?\n\n**COMMAND**: See if there's another one, and try with that one. Maybe a newer looking one?\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Got it. \n\n//She walks down the hallway, before finding another poster.//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Here - this one's blue, has..

Nobody speaks//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Something's definitely not... God, don't know how to describe it.... It's like I've had my stomach turned to liquid.

Put them on shelves in her office. \n\n**MADDIE**: I'm glad to hear that idiocy runs in the family, Turnpike. \n\n**TURNPIKE**: She didn't think it was dangerous. She thought fear was only what we make it, that when we name something as scary it becomes it... she used to place the mercury into my hands, every once in a while. Holding little silver sparks of danger in between my fingers, letting them bead and roll. \n\n//The counter reaches 75% completion.//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: I never really liked the chemical side of things.

My grandma said she was jealous of them - they got to glow in their coffins, apparently. Thinking back, I don't think my Mom would've approved of half the conversations we had.\n\n**MADDIE**: ...

Exploration notes.\n\n//Turnpike breathes deeply//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Back when I was 16, I nearly drove my car off a bridge. I can remember how the sky looked that night. I hadn't told anyone. I don't even know why I didn't go through with it. Something in the air, or maybe I was just a coward? I don't know. Did I ever even have a chance at surviving?\n\n**MADDIE**: You still do.\n\n//A few minutes pass.//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: I haven't told anyone that.\n\n//Another long pause//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: It was a Friday night. I stole my Mom's car keys. She was asleep. Jamie had crashed hard after his football game, and Dad was on call, so there wasn't anyone there to stop me. The floorboards creaked as I walked down them. \n\nI remember the squeal of the tires as I left. There was a small hilly area nearby. I drove slowly, up towards the bridge between one of the peaks that stretched over a river, to another patch. It was right by the old railroad. Stepping out, I could almost hear the train whistle blowing. As if signalling my death.\n\nI stopped just before I swerved off the side. Got out and stood in the night air. It was chilly, fall air, that whipped my cheeks and blew my hair into a mess. It left tears on my face from where it stung my eyes, and yet... something inside me melted enough that I couldn't go through with it. I hadn't met Hope at that point. Hadn't even considered joining theatre yet - I guess I didn't realise that engineering had a place there. God, I remember it though- she looked so pretty, singing...\n\nI almost ended it there, though. I never will forget that. \n\nI didn't, in the end. I turned the car around, and drove back home. Returning was the greatest relief, yet somehow, it made me feel like I'd failed. There's something so heavy about realising that you were nearly dead. That by surviving, you've somehow left behind a ghost there, a million takes of the same scene where you //do// die. \n\nThe same scene, over and over, on loop.\n\nForever. \n\n**MADDIE**: ... is that what people see when they look at me? Just a ghost? A blank spot that some reality bender - no. Eleanor... tore into the world? Ripped out and shoved back in? \n\n//A pause//\n\n**MADDIE**: A ghost on loop?\n\n//Sixteen hours pass//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: How much longer will this be? How many more cycles do I have to live through?\n\n**MADDIE**: I don't know.\n\n//Five hours pass//\n\n**TURNPIKE**: Or is it forever?\n\n**MADDIE**: I... I don't know.\n\n**COMMAND**: Maddie?
