Please stand by.\"]]\n> **[Begin Log]**\n> \n> **Ashcombe:** All right, let's get this fucking thing over with. \n> \n> **Dalton:** The old man's right. I can't take much more of this. But before you all vote for me, I just want to say—\n> \n> **Simmons:** We're not voting for you, moron. \n> \n> **Dalton:** What? Really? Nobody?\n> \n> **Ashcombe:** Fuck you! I'm voting for him!\n> \n> **Long:** I'm not. I'm voting for Jeannie.\n> \n> **Kirkwood:** Love you too, Shells.\n> \n> **Simmons:** People, please. Nobody's voting for anyone yet. I have something to say. \n> \n> **Hughes:** You usually do, yeah.\n> \n> **Simmons:** We've tried a lot of things. We've tried ending the vote in a tie. We've tried not voting at all. But in forty-five years, there's still something we haven't tried. I don't know if it's part of the magic or if we're all just stupid— \n> \n> **Ashcombe:** If you've got a plan, give it to us sometime //today//, please. \n> \n> **Simmons:** Ricks. We need to vote for Dr. Ricks. \n> \n> [11 seconds silence]\n> \n> **Hughes:** Jesus christ.\n> \n> **Ashcombe:** Sure. Worth a shot.\n> \n> **Dalton:** Wait. Wait. I don't understand.\n> \n> **Simmons:** Think about it. We've suspected for years that the game was rigged. \n> \n> //Dr. Ricks, observing the proceedings from the nearby observation room, becomes visibly agitated.//\n> \n> **Research Assistant Baxter:** (//To Dr. Ricks//) Should we intervene?\n> \n> **Dr. Ricks:** Let's wait a moment.\n> \n> **Simmons:** This whole thing is an obvious act of sadism. Something is toying with us. Naturally, then, it would want to watch us. \n> \n> **Dalton:** Dr. Ricks has only been around for, what? Eight years?\n> \n> **Hughes:** We've had other presiding researchers before him. Dr. Olsen, Dr. Smith, Dr. Shipley—\n> \n> **Long:** It could all be the same person! It's changing its shape!\n> \n> **Simmons:** Exactly. \n> \n> **Kirkwood:** Son of a bitch.\n> \n> **Hughes:** Wait, I thought you said you knew?\n> \n> **Kirkwood:** I lied.\n> \n> **Simmons:** So it's settled: we're voting for Ricks. Any objections?\n> \n> //Other subjects express agreement.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ricks:** I'm sorry, I'm afraid that involving any person other than SCP-3306 persons of interest would be considered a breach of containment. \n> \n> **Kirkwood:** Go to hell!\n> \n> **Hughes:** I can't believe we trusted you.\n> \n> **Dr. Ricks:** (//To Research Assistant Baxter//) Issue a lockdown.\n> \n> //Baxter does not respond.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ricks:** Put us on lockdown, damn it!\n> \n> **Research Assistant Baxter:** I'm sorry, I don't... When did you start working here? I'm trying to remember, and I—\n> \n> **Dr. Ricks:** Keep your head. It's memetic! It's affecting your mind! Just issue the lockdown and we can discuss this later.\n> \n> **Research Assistant Baxter:** Why don't //you// issue it, sir? You have clearance, don't you? \n> \n> //Dr. Ricks violently grabs Baxter by the throat.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ricks:** I am a Foundation scientist! I was always a scientist! I didn't want any of this! You think I //liked this?// Fuck you, you don't even—\n> \n> //SCP-3306 abruptly stops turning, causing 3306-POI subjects fall over.//\n> \n> **SCP-3306:** (//Prerecorded message//) Congratulations, you win! We hope you enjoyed the game. Play again soon!\n> \n> //Dr. Ricks releases Research Assistant Baxter, who quickly flees. The lights on SCP-3306 go dark. Dr. Ricks collapses.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ricks:** I see. Thank you for your time.\n> \n> **[End Log]**\n\n**Afterword:** Following this event, SCP-3306 ceased all anomalous activity and 3306-POI subjects were placed under quarantine. Subsequent autopsy of Dr. Rick's body shows that he suffered a fatal heart attack at the time SCP-3306 deactivated. No other anomalous features of the body were observed, and investigators have yet to confirm any abnormalities in Dr. Rick's history with the Foundation. 3306-POI subjects appear to have regained normal biological functions. \n\nBy order of Site Director Goode, if no other anomalous phenomena are observed within a period of 370 days, SCP-3306 is to be reclassified as Neutralized and its documentation rewritten. Once neutralization is confirmed, 3306-POI are to be administered amnestics, assigned new identities, and reintegrated into society.  \n[[/collapsible]]",
