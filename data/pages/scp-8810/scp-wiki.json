Should any participants demonstrate signs of a potential \"litigious\" event, implicated parties are to be seized, subjected to memetic and cognitohazardous deprogramming, and undergo societal reintegration.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8810 is a spontaneous memetic effect that arises sporadically among individuals associated with major organized religions, neo-pagan practices, folk religions, individualized faiths, and supernatural belief groups. This effect produces a profound belief that the divinity, system of worship, or supernatural entity(ies) has neglected or failed the affected persons, and that the only method for reconciliation is legal action.[[footnote]]Primarily in the form of litigation/lawsuits.[[/footnote]] \n\nSCP-8810 does not preferentially target any specific group of individuals of faith or supernatural belief and does not seem to specifically target individuals experiencing outsized financial, physical, mental, or emotional distress. The first documented litigious event associated with SCP-8810 occurred in 1969, but depictions in cultural media such as //The Devil and Daniel Webster// potentially indicate that SCP-8810 has been in the public conscience for some time before the initial incident. \n\nA list of SCP-8810 incidents is provided in the table below.\n\n**T-8810-01:**\n\n|| Incident # || Date || Incident Description || Outcome ||\n|| I-8810-01 || 1969 || Russel T. Tansie filed suit for his secretary, Betty Penrose following a lightning strike on her home. The presented argument was that the Christian God had neglected Mrs. Penrose since the divinity had, supposedly, purchased property within the county. Lou Gottlieb, an American folk singer, had transferred the deed of his ranch property to God earlier in the week.|| The court found the plaintiff lacked standing, and the presiding judge dismissed the case as God is not a legal entity and therefore cannot own property. Additionally, Plaintiff could not show (as a matter of law) that this act of god was the basis for liability when an act of god is usually basis for the opposite as events not controlled by either party. ||\n|| I-8810-03 || 1971 || Bethany Dubois attempted to file suit in South Dakota civil court against Grand Karcist Ion for emotional distress, related to failing to deliver her from the burdens of mortal flesh and thus freeing her from the yoke of existence. Mrs. Dubois had no prior associations with Nälkän or Neo-sarkic groups. It's unclear how Mrs. Dubois became involved with Sarkic religious practices, though some evidence exists that she had ties to the GRU-P. || Foundation officials intercepted Mrs. Dubois' court filing and amnesctized the county clerk who, initially, handled the paperwork. When agents raided Mrs. Dubois' estate, she was found in her bedroom, deceased. Cause of death was cyanide poisoning. ||\n|| I-8810-07 || 1971 || Stephany Hawkins, a resident of Las Vegas Nevada, initiated legal proceedings for alienation of affection against Robert Bumaro and the divinity Mekhane during the divorce of her husband, a known CotBG operative. Mrs. Hawkins accused Bumaro and Mekhane of leading her husband away from matters of the flesh and thus, sabotaging their marriage through deprivation of emotional connection. || Mrs. Hawkins vanished shortly after the filing was submitted. Her husband alleged she went on vacation promptly after proceedings for both the suit and their divorce began. He alleged she had not been returning his calls. Local police opened an investigation into Mrs. Hawkins's disappearance. Upon securing a warrant to search Mr. Hawkins home, they discovered a shrine to Mekhane in his basement, and a large, human-sized pile of scrap metal in one corner. Mr. Hawkins was taken into custody and handed over to the Foundation.|| \n|| I-8810-08 || 1971 || Geraldo Mayo filed suit against 'Satan and his staff' in West Pennsylvania before the United States District Court, alleging that Satan had 'levied unwanted threats, inflicted misery, and impeded important events in his life causing his economic and social downfall'. Mr. Mayo could not afford the legal fees to pursue the case and filed //in forma pauperis// in attempt to have them waived. || Foundation officials were unable to intercept the case before it was processed; however, the attending judge rejected legal proceedings due to the plaintiff failing to include instructions on how 'Satan' could be served for trial.||\n|| I-8810-51 || 1997 || George Castero filed legal action against the Greek divinity \"Zeus\" in both civil and criminal courts before the United States District Court in Eastern Pennsylvania. Mr. Castero alleged that Zeus had 'fucked his wife and turned her into a housecat' and thus filed for both Alienation of Affection. He then called the Philadelphia Police Department to report the crimes of Transmutation[[footnote]]Transmutation is not a crime in any US state.[[/footnote]] and Second-Degree Murder. || As a consequence of prior knowledge, Foundation agents did not interfere with case proceedings. The Civil court dismissed the case on account of Zeus not being a legal entity and therefore could not own property or incur financial harm. Suspecting potential foul play, local authorities investigated further and discovered that Mr. Castero had financial and emotional motive against his wife.[[footnote]] She had been having an affair at the time of her supposed murder.[[/footnote]] The Court notified Foundation Officials, and further investigation determined that Mr. Castero was a type blue associated with the Serpents Hand. He was promptly taken into custody. ||\n|| I-8810-57 || 1998 || A joint suit was filed by the players of the Minnesota Vikings against the 'Norse Pantheon' claiming the organization had colluded to make Gary Anderson's game winning kick in the 1998 NFC championship game miss by a foot to the right. Anderson and multiple other players alleged that Loki[[footnote]]Norse god of Mischief and half-ice giant.[[/footnote]], Odin[[footnote]] Head of the Norse Pantheon and also regarded as a trickster.[[/footnote]] and Thor[[footnote]] God of Thunder and considered notoriously too stupid to be a trickster. [[/footnote]] had appeared in the sky of the domed stadium and caused the kick to veer slightly right of the uprights. || Foundation officials intercepted the filing and brought the entire Vikings team and their coaching staff in for amnestic treatment. Review of the broadcast footage failed to produce any evidence of the alleged events. ||\n|| I-8810-78 || 2014 || Marica Applewhite filed legal proceedings against \"Lycanthropes\". Ms. Applewhite sought 10 million USD for 'Emotional Distress and Alienation of Affection' on account of the defendants failing to fulfill her Omegaverse Fantasies. || Foundation officials failed to prevent Ms. Applewhite's paperwork from being filed, due to a clerical error that temporarily disabled Foundation monitoring databases. The court rejected the case on the basis of \"Lycanthropes and Werewolves\" not being a legitimate organization or business. Additionally, the judge noted that, even if they had been real, suing all Werewolves would have been ludicrous and frivolous. When Ms. Applewhite descended into insults and unruly behavior following the dismissal, the Judge referred to her as \"unhinged\" and promptly held her in contempt of court for a period of 14 days. Mrs. Applewhite promptly escaped her prison cell through unknown means, though several inmates in the station described a \"large, bi-pedal wolf smashing through the walls.\"|| \n|| I-8810-84 || 2016 || In Bihar, India, Chandan Kumar Singh filed suit against the Indian divinity, Rama, in the court of Eastern Bihar. Mr. Singh alleged that Rama had mistreated his wife Sita by asking her to prove she was 'pure', claiming it was important to speak out against such scripture for the betterment of women. || Mr. Singh's case was not caught by Foundation Monitoring systems, due to the lack of precedent of SCP-8810 in Indian Courts, and the case went before the court, where it was promptly rejected for being 'impractical'. ||\n|| I-8810-85 || 2016 || See Incident Log I-8810-85 || Reclassification of SCP-8810 to Keter. ||\n\n[[div class=\"warning-tide opener\"]]\n[[div_ class=\"warning-header\"]]\n**Incident Log I-8810-85**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]**Date:**[[/span]] ██/██/2016\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]**Foreword:**[[/span]] Dave Stillwater filed a lawsuit three months before the events of this incident log; filing a claim against the divinity Inanna, Mesopotamian Queen of Heaven, Goddess of Light, War, Love, and Justice. Mr. Stillwater sought damages for 'Alienation of Affection, Emotional Distress, Social Ostracization, and Discrimination.' Foundation Agents failed to intercept the paperwork or waylay court proceedings.[[footnote]]The case file did not appear in foundation monitoring systems until 24 hours before initial hearings began.[[/footnote]] Case was filed in The Southern District of New York, United States District court. The following log details the entire event. \n\n------\n<Begin Log> \n\n//Recording begins depicting a courtroom within the Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nUnited States Courthouse in lower Manhattan. Mr. Stillwater is seated on the right side, wearing an illfitting, dirty business suit. His lawyer, Mr. R. L. Stanbrook[[footnote]] Mr. Stanbrook was preparing to retire, and Mr. Stillwater was his last case. Mr. Stanbrook was not aware of it, but the immediate dismissal of the case before it reached its first hearing did not occur, due to integration with a coordinated sting with the US Justice department as a result of gross corruption on Mr. Stanbrook's part in aiding/abetting former New York City Mayor ███ ██████. He was to be arrested at the end of the hearing.[[/footnote]], is seated next to him, thumbing through multiple files. The lawyer's expression is noted to be content.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Bailiff:[[/span]] All rise for the honorable Judge Marrowitz. \n\n//Judge Marrowitz enters the courtroom and ascends to take the bench.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] You may all sit.\n\n//There are 10 other people in the room other than the claimant, bailiffs and the judge.

The defendant responded to our notice, and affirmed they wished to bring this to the court. \n\n//Judge Marrowitz stares at Mr. Stanbrook, and then Mr. Stillwater for several seconds.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] They’re-- I see. Well as the opposing council and their client have not appeared, and it's--\n\n//Judge Marrowitz checks her watch.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Half an hour past our start time, let’s see the proof that you've contacted the defendants and then we'll go from there. \n\n//Mr. Stanbrook pulls out several pieces of paper.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stanbrook:[[/span]] May I approach the bench, your honor?\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Go ahead.\n\n//Mr. Stanbrook enters the pulpit and hands Judge Marrowitz the papers. She looks them over for several seconds mumbling the words 'Spain?' to herself.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Let the record show that the claimants contacted the defendant and they were served. Lets hear the case and requested damages from you and your client directly, and I will render summary judgement from there.\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stanbrook:[[/span]] Your honor, my client is seeking civil damages equivalent to 15 million dollars from the defendant, Inanna also known as Abigail Im-Immaru[[footnote]]PoI-Valencia-02[[/footnote]], Queen of Heaven, Goddess of Light, War, Love, and Justice--\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] I see you included the full title in the filing as well Mr. Stanbrook, was that necessary?\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stanbrook:[[/span]] My client insisted. My client is suing Mrs. Im-Immaru for Alienation of Affection, Emotional Distress, Social Ostracization, and Discrimination. Following an event where he invested a significant amount of effort to please the defendant in order to ensure 'gain of favor and boons'. \n\n//Mr. Stanbrook exhibits notable difficulty in keeping a straight face.// \n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stanbrook:[[/span]] Mr. Stillwater is a self-described 'Involuntary Celibate' and alleges that Mrs. Im-Immaru's failure to follow up on an established contract has done egregious harm to his reputation and standing among members of his community. \n\n//Judge Marrowitz's expression becomes incredulous, but she maintains composure and gestures to Mr. Stillwater.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Mr. Stanbrook do you have evidence of this 'contract'? \n\n//Mr. Stanbrook holds up a small binder. Judge Marrowitz gestures for Mr. Stanbrook to approach the stand.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stanbrook:[[/span]] I submit for the court's approval exhibit 1A, 1B, and if you'll direct your attention to the screen, 1C. Proof of contract in the form of photographic evidence, peer reviewed documentation of contract proceedings with the Goddess Inanna, and video evidence showing breach of contract. \n\n//Judge Marrowitz takes the binder and opens it, a shocked expression crossing her face as she flips through the pages. She then looks up and watches the video play. All court attendees exhibit expressions of shock or disgust. Two people leave the courtroom.//\n\n[COGNITOHAZARDOUS MATERIAL REMOVED]\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Mr. Stillwater, would you please describe for the court how you formed a contract with Inanna?\n\n//Mr. Stillwater stands, and speaks in a reedy, nasally voice.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stillwater:[[/span]] If it pleases the court. I converted to Neo-paganism six months ago after a dream where Inanna-- Mrs. Im-Immaru appeared to me and said that if I bestowed upon her a glorious gift while reciting the prayer we've submitted to the court, she would shower me with unending favor and promises ending the curse of my involuntary celibacy, by making all the bitches want me.\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Mr. Stillwater, you will watch your language in my courtroom.\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stillwater:[[/span]] Sorry, your honor.\n\n//The cameras pick up Judge Marrowitz speaking to herself at an audio-level that the rest of the court doesn't hear.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] What a farce.\n\n//At a louder volume she says.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Before I issue my ruling, Mr. Stanbrook does your client have any proof that Mrs. Im-Immaru is a real entity with financial holdings? \n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stanbrook:[[/span]] Yes, your honor, if you'll flip to the last page, we'll enter exhibit Item 1D, proof of finances. \n\n//Judge Marrowitz flips to the last page and looks over the statement.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] So, just so that the court and I fully understand, Mrs. Im-Immaru co-owns a nightclub in Ibiza, Spain, called the Evening Star, and you're claiming she came to you in a dream, promised you... 'Women'? and favors if you...\n\n//Judge Marrowitz gestures to the binder.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Did this, and said a prayer to her? \n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stillwater:[[/span]] And post it online. She was very specific about that.\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Right. So, you did as she instructed, and the outcome has been...\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mr. Stanbrook:[[/span]] Social ostracization, harassment, removal from online community and safe spaces, and discrimination in the form of Mrs. Im-Immaru completely ignoring his prayers and pleas. Financial difficulty due to loss of employment. \n\n//Judge Marrowitz speaks again at a volume the court room can't hear.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Not surprised at all.\n\n//At a normal volume.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] Ok. Mr. Stillwater, one last thing.

I'm sure you'll find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\n//Mrs. Im-Immaru blows a kiss at the camera, a heart shaped neon-light floating through the air and briefly filling the entire field before dissolving.

It is now oriented in a night club style layout. All walls and ceilings are now dance floors covered in fluorescing tiles as a dozen signs stating the case name flash on every surface. Humanoid shaped neon light constructs dance on the floor, the walls, and ceilings at angles that would be impossible if gravity was behaving normally.

The seating arrangements have swapped, Neon blinking placards in cuneiform reading \"Prosecution\" displayed on the table on the right side where Mrs. Sukkal-Mah is seated. No table is on the left side where the defendants would normally be, instead a large wheel with different colored neon panels sits in its place. Mr. Stillwater is strapped to the wheel, which is split into two segments rotating in opposite directions. ~12 Mr. Stanbrooks are strapped to the walls, attached to the neon lights dictating the case title. Every time the color changes, Mr. Stanbrook screams as he's electrocuted, the tones of his screams being harvested and distorted into electronic music.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Im-Immaru:[[/span]] Welcome ladies, gentlemen, and enbies of all flavors, I'm your host Abigail, and this is CRIMINAL COURT WITH JUDGE MARROWITZ!\n\n//Cheers go up from both the human spectators and the neon-light humanoid constructs.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Im-Immaru:[[/span]] Nancy why don't you go ahead and tell us what our defendants here are being charged with based on the evidence and testimony we saw today?\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Marrowitz:[[/span]] This has gone from a nightmare to a night terror. \n\n//Judge Marrowitz begins drinking from a flask covered in strobing neon lights.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mrs. Sukkal-Mah:[[/span]] As you saw earlier your honor, Mr. Stillwater incriminated himself by presenting video and photographic evidence of violation of New York Penal Law - PEN § 235.00, PEN § 353-A, & PEN § 245. \n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Im-Immaru:[[/span]] Ooooo those are nasty!\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Mrs. Sukkal-Mah:[[/span]]  The State of New York has detailed paper trail evidence that Mr. Stanbrook violated New York Penal Law § 496.05, gross cases of embezzlement, taking bribes, paired with aiding and abetting criminal conspiracy. While not necessarily a violation of the law, and thus not of terrible relevancy to current proceedings, I'd also like to submit for the record that Mr. Stanbrook is a soulless hack for tieing his reputation to a client that ignored his warnings about the evidence presented here today being wildly self-incriminating.\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Im-Immaru:[[/span]] I agree, bully on you Mr. Stanbrook.

Outside she snaps a finger, and a motorcycle made of strobing neon lights manifests. She mounts it, hikes up the parking stand and revs the engine.//\n\n[[span class=\"hili\"]]Judge Im-Immaru:[[/span]] Let this be a lesson, don't fucking sue me assholes.\n\n//Judge Im-Immaru takes off, leaving a trail of streaking light.//\n\n//As soon as Mrs. Im-Immaru is out of frame, the camera distorts, slingshotting back to its original position. At this point, a SWAT team storms the courtroom and takes both Mr. Stanbrook and Mr. Stillwater into custody without resistance, as they are prostrated on the floor of the pulpit, foaming at the mouth and unconscious.
