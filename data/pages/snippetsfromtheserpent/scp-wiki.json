Why are you cracking my site? What the fuck do you want from me?\n<no1uno> I want to make you an offer. I'm tired. I've been doing this for... for too long. It has taken a  toll on my mind as well as my body.\n<~3rdSister> What makes you think I want it? \n<no1uno> Because you asked for it, Claire.
