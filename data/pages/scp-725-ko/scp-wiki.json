Therefore, when a white fallow deer suspected to be SCP-725-KO is seen within Jeju island, Site-13K is to dispatch personnel, including a veterinary specialist and secure the target as per the following protocol.\n\n* Dispatched personnel spray predator excrement over a 250-meter radius from the presumed location of the target, sealing off the area and spreading misinformation. This is done to prevent the suspected SCP-725-KO entity from moving to another location or civilians from entering the sealed area and witnessing the entity. However, since SCP-725-KO may escape by using its anomalous properties due to its fear of aircraft, personnel must only travel on foot or by ground vehicles without using aircraft such as helicopters.\n\n* After the area is secured, the dispatched personnel place 500g of liquid feed, containing a large amount of sedatives for capturing SCP-725-KO, in designated containers equipped with cameras and distribute them throughout the area. Once this is done, the crew withdraw from the area. Even if they spot the suspected SCP-725-KO entity during this process, they should not look at or approach the target.\n\n* Using the cameras attached to the containers, personnel estimate the number of suspected SCP-725-KO entities within the sealed area and verify whether the targets have consumed the feed. Once it is confirmed that all suspected SCP-725-KO entities have consumed the feed, the crew are allowed to enter the sealed area 3 hours after the consumption of the feed by all entities has been verified.\n\n* Personnel that entered the area collect blood samples from the suspected SCP-725-KO entities under sedation. Using on-site identification equipment, they determine whether the suspected entities are SCP-725-KO or non-anomalous deer. An identification tag is be attached to the right ear of confirmed SCP-725-KO entities. Afterwards, all secured SCP-725-KO entities and the non-anomalous fallow deer are sedated with an appropriate anaesthetic and transported to Containment Sector 725-KO, the designated containment facility for SCP-725-KO. The area is then unsealed.\n@@@@\n@@@@\nContainment Sector 725-KO, part of Site-13K Halla Facilities, is located within the forest of a national park and is unknown to the public. Personnel assigned to Containment Sector 725-KO must employ every available method to prevent civilian access while ensuring no noise or disturbances occur that could cause SCP-725-KO to feel threatened.\n\nThe SCP-725-KO entities and non-anomalous fallow deer, secured and transported to the containment unit, remain sedated as identification tags are attached to their left ears. Afterwards, they are examined in the veterinary wing to check for diseases. The SCP-725-KO entities are then separated by gender and moved to the quarantine enclosure, where they will be remotely fed sedative-laced food for one week to help them adjust to the facility as they awaken from sedation. The non-anomalous fallow deer are sent to the training enclosure to familiarise them with the management personnel.\n\nAfter one week in the quarantine enclosure, non-anomalous fallow deer, trained to have less aversion to personnel, are introduced to the SCP-725-KO entities of the same gender. This integration aims to familiarise the SCP-725-KO entities with containment personnel. When the SCP-725-KO entities become more friendly to the personnel through these measures, the SCP-725-KO entities and the non-anomalous fallow deer in the quarantine enclosure are transferred to the main enclosure. They are integrated with the previously contained SCP-725-KO entities and non-anomalous fallow deer for continued care and management.\n\nFor more detailed information about the structure of Containment Sector 725-KO and raising protocols for contained SCP-725-KO, refer to [[[containment-sector-725-ko|]]].\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Description:** SCP-725-KO refers to an anomalous population of leucistic fallow deer (//Dama dama//) exhibiting white fur, sighted around Jeju Island. Though they show no differences in appearance or genetics compared to non-anomalous leucistic fallow deer, a unique substance, [REDACTED], is detected only in the blood of SCP-725-KO. This substance distinguishes SCP-725-KO from wild, non-anomalous leucistic fallow deer inhabiting Jeju Island.\n\nThe anomalous property of SCP-725-KO is time travel. Regardless of gender or age, SCP-725-KO entities can escape into the past when they feel threatened and are physically unable to flee. The process through which the entity initiates time travel unfolds as follows.\n\n* When SCP-725-KO detects a threat, such as a predator attempting to attack or being captured, the entity immediately begins convulsing, stiffening its legs straight and standing upright with its eyes open in a rigid state. While in this rigid state, SCP-725-KO levitates into the air and emits a bright light from its entire body.\n\n* SCP-725-KO, while emitting light and levitating, continues to rise until it is obstructed. Without obstacles, it ascends to a maximum height of approximately 5 meters. The light emitted by SCP-725-KO becomes brighter the longer it remains in the air.\n\n* The intensity of the light emitted by SCP-725-KO peaks at approximately 20,000 to 30,000 lumens. At peak intensity, the light abruptly extinguishes, and the entity vanishes. This entire process, during which SCP-725-KO performs its time travel, lasts between 2 minutes and 3 minutes 40 seconds.\n\nWhen SCP-725-KO disappears, any foreign objects attached to its body also vanish. However, if the entity is tied with a rope connected to larger or fixed objects such as trees, stones, or stakes embedded in the ground, only SCP-725-KO disappears, leaving the rope behind. It has been confirmed that objects larger or fixed in place do not travel with SCP-725-KO during its time displacement.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nDuring time travel, SCP-725-KO remains rigid, showing no physical movement other than rising upward and blinking. However, the intense light emitted during this process often frightens most predators, causing them to cease their attack and flee. It is believed that most humans attempting to capture SCP-725-KO also reacted similarly, abandoning their efforts due to the fear induced by the light.\n\nHowever, it is possible to inflict physical harm on SCP-725-KO during the process. Injuries sustained during this phase can lead to the entity's death, even while time travelling. If SCP-725-KO dies during this process, it loses its anomalous properties, the light it emits extinguishes, and the time travel halts. The body then falls to the ground.\n\nThe physical durability and lifespan of SCP-725-KO are understood to be identical to those of non-anomalous fallow deer. The Foundation has secured and contained 38 SCP-725-KO entities—13 stags and 25 does to date. However, only 27 entities (8 stags and 19 does) currently remain in containment due to containment failures, escape, or death from injuries and natural causes.\n\nThrough breeding among the SCP-725-KO entities in containment, five stags and eight does have been born. It has been confirmed that all the fawns contain the unique substance, [REDACTED], in their blood, just like the original SCP-725-KO entities. However, further experiments have been prohibited due to concerns over potential large-scale containment failures. Hence, whether the fawns born in containment possess the same anomalous properties is unknown.\n\nIt has been confirmed that SCP-725-KO can also breed with non-anomalous fallow deer. However, the fawns from such pairings do not contain [REDACTED] in their blood, indicating that they are merely non-anomalous fallow deer.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nThe origin of SCP-725-KO is believed to be traced back to leucistic fallow deer released by or escaped from civilians on Jeju Island, intending to populate the Baengnokdam crater on Mt. Halla with white deer. As previously mentioned, SCP-725-KO entities are identical in appearance and genetics to non-anomalous fallow deer. Moreover, no notable internal organs that could induce anomalous properties have been identified through dissection. Therefore, the cause of SCP-725-KO's ability to travel in time remains unknown.\n\nSeveral hypotheses, such as spatial displacement and dimensional travel, were initially proposed to explain SCP-725-KO's anomalous properties. However, after Incident 725-KO-02, it was concluded that SCP-725-KO's anomaly is time travel. Additionally, Incident 725-KO-05 implies that SCP-725-KO may have travelled as far back as 500 years into the past.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Incident 725-KO-02:**\n> [[=]]\n> **Brief**\n> [[/=]]\n> On April 12, 2015, while securing non-contained SCP-725-KO entities, a male instance, with its left eye and part of its right hind leg missing, fled using its anomalous trait. The stag was bound by a net with an attached tracking device with an engraving of its serial number. The device's signal was lost after the incident.\n> \n> Dr. ███ discovered an entry in the Log of Extranormal Events three days after the incident. The entry, dated December 1, 1999, described the appearance of a male fallow deer, perfectly matching the description of the escaped SCP-725-KO entangled in a net. The body appeared approximately 2 metres above the rooftop of a building in ███, Jeju Special Autonomous Province, accompanied by a bright light. This location was more than 2 km from where the SCP-725-KO had fled.\n> \n> Upon reviewing the photographic evidence of the fallow deer's body from the incident, along with the net and equipment recovered at the time that were classified as anomalous items, it was confirmed that the physical characteristics of the deer and the serial number on the attached tracking device matched those of the escaped SCP-725-KO entity. After replacing the battery in the tracking device and switching it on, the device functioned normally.\n> \n> Through this series of events, it was concluded that SCP-725-KO's anomaly involves time travel. However, since this incident only confirmed travel to the past, it remains unknown whether SCP-725-KO can time travel to the future.\n-----\n**Incident 725-KO-05:**\n> [[=]]\n> **Brief**\n> [[/=]]\n> On August 2, 2020, Foundation agents intercepted a message from a civilian, Mr Park ██, who expressed interest in donating antlers from white deer living in Baengnokdam, along with other Jeju-sourced antler artefacts, to the Jeju National Museum. The description included remarks such as, \"White deer antlers are flatter than regular deer antlers.\" Following this, agents disguised as museum staff visited Mr Park's residence, gathered information on the antler artefacts and administered amnestic treatment to him. They secured one pair of white deer antlers and three regular deer antlers that Mr. Park had intended to donate.\n> \n> All of the secured deer antlers had barely discernible symbols or drawings on their surface. According to Mr Park, the antlers came from deer his ancestors, who were hunters, had captured on Mt. Halla. However, the white deer antlers were different—because it was believed that one should not hunt the sacred white deer, they were collected after naturally shedding in the spring. These antlers had been passed down through his family as treasured heirlooms.\n> \n> Following an investigation by Foundation researchers, it was concluded that the pair of antlers Mr Park had described as \"white deer antlers,\" which also appeared different from the others, belonged to a fallow deer (//Dama dama//). The other three pairs of antlers were identified as belonging to a sika deer (//Cervus nippon// ssp.). Radiocarbon dating estimated that all the antlers dated back approximately 500 to 650 years.\n> \n> The morphological and genetic analysis confirmed that one of the antlers is indeed from a fallow deer. However, since the only distinguishing feature between SCP-725-KO and non-anomalous fallow deer is a difference in blood composition, it was impossible to differentiate them based on the appearance or genetics of the antlers. Therefore, whether the \"white deer antlers\" in question remain part of an SCP-725-KO entity remains unclear. Given SCP-725-KO's anomalous time travel abilities, potentially extending 500 years into the past, if Mr. Park's claims are valid, there is a high likelihood that this pair of fallow deer antlers could belong to an SCP-725-KO entity.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Additional Information:**\n> [[=]]\n> **//Analysis of the Relationship Between Leucistic Fallow Deer Released on Jeju Island and SCP-725-KO// – Summary**\n> Written by Dr Lee Hyeok^^1^^, Dr Kim Hyeonsu^^2^^, Researcher Lee Hocheol^^3^^\n> \n> ,,1.

Based on an article from the //[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maeil_Sinbo Maeil Sinbo]// dated May 20, 1937, it is estimated that the white fallow deer were first introduced to Korea around 1937 at Changgyeongwon zoo. However, given the extermination of most of the exhibited animals at the zoo due to Japan's predatory species eradication policy and the Korean War, it is believed that the fallow deer currently being raised in Korea originated from individuals imported after the Korean War.\n> \n> Despite the long history of breeding fallow deer, which has resulted in various colour variations among the species, most fallow deer raised in Korea are predominantly white. This is likely due to the distinct difference that leucistic (white) individuals exhibit compared to other deer species and a cultural belief in Korea that white animals possess mystical powers. This trend is further evidenced by misleading promotion, where fallow deer bred to be white are exhibited with claims such as \"extremely rare deer\" or \"sacred animals,\" reflecting the preference for these characteristics within Korea.\n> \n> At the summit of Mt. Halla, the caldera, Baengnokdam, uses the name \"Baengnok\" (白鹿), meaning \"white deer,\" and is associated with various legends involving white deer. However, the only deer species currently native to Jeju Island is the **Jeju roe deer** (//Capreolus pygargus tianschanicus//). The **Manchurian sika deer** (//Cervus nippon mantchuricus//), believed to have once inhabited the island, is now extinct on Jeju. In addition to the Manchurian sika deer, feral populations of other non-native deer species, such as **sika deer** (//Cervus nippon// ssp.) and **red deer** (//Cervus elaphus// ssp.), have also been confirmed to inhabit Jeju Island.\n> \n> However, some civilians, unable to differentiate between deer species, have attempted to introduce and release foreign deer on Jeju Island under reasons such as \"restoring white deer to Baengnokdam.\" The obsession with \"white deer\" led to attempts to introduce leucistic fallow deer—non-native deer bred to have white fur—onto the island. There have even been confirmed cases of actual releases, as noted in [http://mn.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=3733837 this example]. SCP-725-KO is believed to have originated from these fallow deer, either released or have escaped into the wild on Jeju Island. However, further research is required to understand how these introduced deer or their descendants acquired anomalous properties and became SCP-725-KO.\n> -----\n> **Additional Documents:**\n> [[=]]\n> [[collapsible show=\"Article from page 6 of Maeil Sinbo dated May 20, 1937 \"White Deer at Ch'anggyŏngwŏn Zoo\"\" hide=\"Stop Viewing\"]]\n> [[<]]\n> [[tabview]]\n> [[tab Article Translation]]\n> [[=]]\n> ++ **White Deer at Ch'anggyŏngwŏn Zoo**\n> **\"Faro Deer\" from \"Africa\"\n> **\"First Visit\" to the Far East\n> [[/=]]\n>\n> Among animals, the deer, often hailed as a mystical creature, is usually known to have either dark or yellowish fur. But times have changed, and this era brings about unusual marvels. The colour of this deer has likewise transformed, and just as described in //Ongnokki// (The Chronicles of a Jade Deer), a pure white deer has made its appearance as a distinguished guest at the Ch'anggyŏngwŏn Zoo, drawing quite the attention. This rare-coloured deer family consists of three still-young members, so their antlers have yet to grow. Whether their antlers will also turn white remains to be seen. This deer hails from Africa, and when Germany's Hagenbeck Circus visited recently, it was exchanged for a Korean deer. Its name is \"Faro Deer\", and this is the first time such a specimen has been imported to the Far East.\n> \n> (The photo is the White Deer)\n> \n> [[/tab]]\n> [[tab Original Article]]\n> [[image https://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-725-ko/mailsinbo-19370520.png]]\n> [[/tab]]\n> [[/tabview]]\n> [[/collapsible]]\n> [[/<]]\n> [http://jst.re.kr/jejustudiesDetail.do?cid=010300&mid=RC00000236 2012 Hallasan National Park Natural Resource Survey]\n> [[/=]]\n> @@@@\n> @@@@",
