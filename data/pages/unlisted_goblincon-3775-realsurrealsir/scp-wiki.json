Individual developments will be compared across different instances to identify and investigate correlations across disparate instances and any potential causal factors involved. \n\nIf learned of in advance, associated out-of-school field trips and excursions are to be covertly monitored whenever circumstances allow. Any small-scale anomalous objects or events which are observed in association with SCP-3775 activities are to be collected or recorded as necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3775 is the collective designation for at least 49 extracurricular organizations across various high schools in the Western U.S. affected by a series of closely-related phenomena in which student organizations begin to shift in overall purpose, activities, and individual student behaviors towards increasingly vague and often bizarre or seemingly non-sensical practices that nonetheless closely resemble each other in specific ways across individual schools and clubs, even without any observed evidence of any direct communication between instances or clear purpose behind their occurrence. \n\nThere have been several noted factors associated with most or all SCP-3775 instances that indicate an existing student organization has become affected by SCP-3775, usually affecting either the actual student group's goals and behaviors or individual group members' personality, priorities, and personal belief systems, as well as those of other individuals close to them to a more limited extent. Other common factors include:\n* Thematic shift in the attitudes and activities towards subjects related to music, naturalism, modern history, and/or visual media;\n* Increased frequency and length of after-school or weekend meetings and events;\n* Parental and faculty encouragement of student commitment and devotion to their SCP-3775 affected club, regardless of any previous attitudes and/or resulting conflict with other priorities like other clubs and hobbies, friends and family, academic performance, etc.;\n* Alleviation of any pre-existing interpersonal conflicts between individual club members, as well as near-universal hostility towards any students who leave regardless of usual personality, pre-existing relationships, or even reason for breaking off. For example, one Indiana student and member of a local art club who is hospitalized for an extended period after an auto accident began receiving insulting and hurtful letters from other members, even including stated opinions like \"It would have been better if that truck finished the job\" from his then-girlfriend.\n-----\n@@ @@\n+++ **__Addendum__**\nA log of notable, unique, and or representative examples of SCP-3775 instances is available below:\n\n**East Provo Drama Club**\n-----\nProvo, Utah\n-----\nChosen plays and performances put on by the group every few months shifts towards performing almost exclusively musicals; particularly those with themes such as memory, community, and loss.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**MPHS Audiovisual Club**\n-----\nLuton, Montana\n-----\nRelatively limited activity shift in comparison to other SCP-3775 instances, though marked and positive shift in attitudes among the broader student body soon becomes apparent, as the previously undesirable social status of many club members is replaced with a broad and often bizarre focus or insistence by other students and faculty alike for AV club members to be at events in and out of school; particularly to record, photograph, and generally \"maintain memories\" from any such community and student body activities.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**Kirk Lonwood High Marching Band**\n-----\nThe band becomes increasingly popular and central to the school's overall focus, culture, and resource allocation, culminating in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-332 Incident 332-A]. The band was abolished after intensive Foundation intervention.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**James Monroe High Astronomy Club**\n-----\nCasper, Wyoming\n-----\nGroup changes name to //Stargazers Club// under the auspices of \"not limiting themselves\". The focus of activity soon in focus to studying and observing stellar objects and constellations to following news of celebrities, first mainly musical artists and eventually shifting solely to musicians, with an increasing focus on classical and orchestral figures as opposed to modern artists and celebrities.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**FHS Sustainability Club**\n-----\nFargo, North Dakota\n-----\nInitial focus on environmental issues and advocacy for sustainable living practices becomes increasingly focused on rivers, lakes, and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2316 bodies of water]. They soon change their name to the \"FHS hydrology club\". By the end of the 1975-1976 school year, attitudes towards preserving and protecting aquatic areas and systems had almost completely inverted, with students showing severe hydrophobia combined with morbid fascination (or even hyper-fixation), and actively attempting to block off, pollute, and/or advocate drastic geoengineering projects to interfere with or destroy most nearby aquatic bodies and locations.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**Carson Acadamy Young Naturalists**\n-----\nBoise, Idaho\n-----\nPrevious activities comprising a healthy mix of camping trips, wildlife education, landmark field trips, and outdoor safety education become more and more narrowed in scope towards recurring trips to state and national parks, and eventually almost solely weekly purported trips to Yellowstone National Park. Despite this, no firm physical evidence or witness testimony has been found to verify their actual arrival to the area during any of these trips. In fact, the entire group has never been able to be accounted for while on such excursions. \n-----\n@@ @@\n+++ **__UPDATE 22/11/2025:__**\nWith a marked decline in the observed severity and volume of affected schools after a peak in the 1975-1976 school year, the last known even weakly affected instances appear to have phased out on their own by around [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4833 2019]. However, starting in the 2024-2025 school year, readily apparent new and returned SCP-3775-affected student organizations have been noticed across the previously affected region. \n\nThis has seemed to coincide with a pattern of graduates from schools previously affected by SCP-3775 instances frequently and publicly reporting dreams and surreal memories related to experiences which often directly tied to events and student organizations affected by SCP-3375 activity. This includes at least --5-- --7-- 13 Foundation Staff of varied security clearance, personal backgrounds, and job duties. [[footnote]]All such staff have been placed under covert monitoring and assigned to mandatory therapy and psychological examinations.[[/footnote]]\n\nCommon mental images, visions, and dreams have been noted to include the following recurring aspects:\n* Sudden Nostalgia for high school experiences, even if previously detested  and/or forgotten;\n* Faceless humanoid apparitions\n* Preoccupation with music and memory in such a way as to frequently take their entire attention regardless of other activities and priorities for extended periods of time;\n* Questioning of well-established past events and frequent feelings of severe //deja vu//.\n\nWhile many affected individuals have undergone various types of amnestic treatment in relation to their past experiences, such history alarmingly appears to have little to no effect on these recently returned memories. Approximately 38% of such individuals have also been reported missing, and no such individual has yet been found after their disappearance. Investigation into these phenomena is ongoing, and updated containment strategies are being finalized and readied for broad application. However, by O5 Council decree as of November 12, 2025, any uncharacteristic statements or expressions noted by affected individuals of \"50th Class Reunion\", \"Bringing back\" or \"returning [a/the] 'Symphony'\", and \"Giving [oneself] over to the [music/mask/memories]\" is subject to immediate capture and indefinite containment of said individuals.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3774]]] | **SCP-3775** | [[[SCP-3776]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
