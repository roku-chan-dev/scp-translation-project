As with [[[art:inkscapetober day 2 suit| Kain Pathos Crow]]] I tried to represent the most famous SCPs by the author. First and foremostly this means that I had to include [[[SCP-682]]]. And the only reasonable way I could think of doing so, was by adding a picture of 682 itself. This one is made by [[*user Dr Whitney]], whose art can be found [[[Dr Whitney's Art Pile| here]]]. Furthermore there had to be some gears on this coat. I eventually those to include [[[SCP-217]]], for it seems that Dr Gears's work itself is infested by it. Lastly, the interseting shape of this coat of arms is inspired by [[[SCP-184]]].\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** So there's two ways I tried to incorporate the prompt this time. First off, there's 682, which is stuck in a chamber of acid. Secondly, there's the clockwork, which despite my best attempts is probably very much unable to function properly.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-11-sour| Day 11: Sour]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-13-roof| Day 13: Roof]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Dr_Gears.png\n> **Name:** Dr_Gears\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nDr_Gears.png is a composite.
