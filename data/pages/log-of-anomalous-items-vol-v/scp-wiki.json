Anyone viewing the poster becomes consumed by the question and is only satisfied upon learning the location of their children, if any exist.  The effect on childless subjects is easily broken by reminding them that they do not have children.\n**Date of Recovery:** 2023-04-30\n**Location of Recovery:** Found behind another poster in a frame at a garage sale in Orlando, Florida.\n**Current Status:** In storage.\n**Note:** //The seller of the frame denied any knowledge of the anomalous item.

The method the item uses to solve has been identified as the //Petrus//[[footnote]] Rubik's Cube solving method[[/footnote]] method. When the item is solved, the item will quickly scramble itself at a rate of 10 TPS and finish in around 5 seconds. The item will ignore impossible scrambles and will solve itself as if it is possible. When a person is actively using the item, all anomalous properties will be inactive, it will come back if the item is not being actively used.\n**Date of Recovery:** 2023-07-06\n**Location of Recovery:** An abandoned house in █████████, China\n**Current Status:** Kept in Site-98 breakroom.\n\n**Item Description:** A poster showing a picture of Earth that, when viewed, causes the viewer to jump and yell \"HUZZAH!\"\n**Date of Recovery:** 2014-02-08\n**Location of Recovery:** A warehouse in █████████, █████████.\n**Current Status:** Kept in Site-87 storage.\n\n**Item Description:** Approximately 2.9 metric tons of dirt and topsoil which is anomalously incapable of supporting the growth of any living sedentary organism, regardless of an ordinarily viable nutrient content, and the presence of light and water.

All other Foundation aircraft using this engine model had already been retired several years earlier for this reason.\n\n**Item Description:** American flag with 67 stars instead of the standard 50.  Anyone viewing the item directly suffers a cognitohazardous effect that causes them to believe this is the proper number and all other flags are wrong.
