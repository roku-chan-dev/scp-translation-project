Despite being a death row inmate, to the Foundation's eyes he has an unusual expertise on military combat and an awareness of the Foundation's motives.\nHowever, the Foundations is unable to identify any more information to his background and treats him like a special expendable for tedious and dangerous experiments.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[ꌅꈼꂠꁲꀯꋖꈼꂠ]\" hide=\"- Hide block\"]]\n\n**Name:** Takumi Kamiyama (Eng.
