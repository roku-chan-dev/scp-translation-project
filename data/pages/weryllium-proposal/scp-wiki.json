Please forward to designated personnel.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n**Item #:** SCP-001-J\n\n**Object Class:** Agape\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Dr. Palanez, the current host of SCP-001-J, is no longer capable of containing it internally. SCP-001-J is to be transferred to Researcher Nogales upon completion of this document. \n\n**Description:** SCP-001-J is a metaphysical concept that manifests primarily via emotions. An instance of SCP-001-J currently exists within Dr. Palanez but is strongly theorized to exist in Researcher Nogales as well.\n\nSCP-001-J has effected changes in the behavior and personality of its host, Dr. Palanez. These changes include but are not limited to:\n* Elevated levels of endorphins\n* Positive mood\n* Improved outlook on life\n* Irrationality\n* Spontaneous and involuntary smiling\n* Lachrymal discharge from eyes\n* Increased empathy\n* Optimism\n* Formation of concrete future plans\n* Extravagant purchases\n* A tendency to share deep personal experiences with another SCP-001-J host\n* Emotional and physical intimacy with another SCP-001-J host\n\nThe current SCP-001-J instances appear to have spontaneously manifested during a shared meal within the Site-119 Cafeteria. Informal research and rampant speculation by other Site-119 personnel support this hypothesis.\n\nA large number of specific circumstances and behaviors have been confirmed to strengthen the effects of SCP-001-J ; this list has been compiled by Dr. Palanez. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-001-J Intensifiers\" hide=\"ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n* Researcher Nogales' smile\n* Researcher Nogales' laugh\n* The way Researcher Nogales' eyes widen a tiny bit when smiling\n* Consumption of baked goods prepared by Researcher Nogales \n* Boarding of amusement park rides with Researcher Nogales (notably, SCP-001-J appears to counteract the usual acrophobia that would otherwise be exhibited by Dr. Palanez)\n* Viewing and discussion of animated series with Researcher Nogales \n* Attempting to paint portraits of Researcher Nogales \n* Researcher Nogales' responses to said portraits\n* Receiving emotional comfort from Researcher Nogales when Dr. Palanez's father passed away\n* Walking through the Site-119 garden late at night with Researcher Nogales and prompting several attempts to serenade, poorly\n* The way that simply looking into Researcher Nogales' eyes can make every dark day just a little bit brighter\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSCP-001-J is theorized to possess a long gestation period, as it remained dormant in both its hosts for several years before exhibiting most of its symptoms. SCP-001-J is incurable, and its symptoms continue to grow in severity with time. \n\n**Addendum:** \n> **Dr. Palanez:** SCP-001-J cannot be contained. However, I have devised a new proposal to properly deal with its effects. Researcher Nogales, will you marry me?\n> \n> **Researcher Nogales:** Proposal accepted, you dork.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
