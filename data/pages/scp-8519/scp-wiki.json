However, in attempts to slow membership of SCP-8519, a disinformation campaign has been launched throughout several social media and mainstream news outlets, calling out SCP-8519 for the mistreatment of its members.\n\nAll captured instances of SCP-8519-A are to undergo weekly therapy sessions with a Site-414 psychologist. \n\n**Description:** SCP-8519 refers to a youth organization for girls developed by GOI-4319 [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/just-girly-things-hub|(“Just Girly Things”)]]] titled the “Sprinkle Scouts”. SCP-8519 has troops stationed all over the United States and Canada, although no set locations have been identified. However, members of SCP-8519 have been discovered by the Foundation. \n\nSCP-8519-A refers to the members of SCP-8519. SCP-8519-A instances have the capability to sell and produce cookies at an impossible rate for the average human. Exact numbers are unknown, but at the highest SCP-8519-A instances have sold up to 100 boxes of cookies a day, and produced up to 500 boxes of cookies a day. Cookies are produced by SCP-8519-A instances using standard ovens, baking materials, and ingredients. It is unknown how instances work at their current speeds. \n\nLeaders belonging to SCP-8519 will often use cognitohazardous materials in promotional material to anomalously compel subjects to join. \n\n**Addendum-1:** Website\n\nSCP-8519 was discovered when an SCP-8519 recruiting website for the group was posted online under the web address ‘www.sprinklescouts.██ The following is a collection of posts and web pages from the website.

In 2006, Just Girly Things was created by the wonderful KeeLee Auburn! I joined JGT when I was only 13! Can you believe it? Ever since I was a kid, I believed in being the best girl I could be. I wanted to do something special for JGT, to repay all the wonderful things JGT has done for me.\n\n When I was older, it came to me. The perfect thing to help out. A youth group meant for young girls where they can learn how to be the perfect woman. My girly Ella suggested that I make it related to sweets, since who doesn't love sweets? With that, the Sprinkle Scouts were born! We figured that we could have girls sell cookies to make more money for the group so we can help provide for them even more! Amazing, right? \n\nI'm currently the troop leader for the top LA-based troop, along with my sister Elizabeth! We are graciously watched over by my husband, Robert, to make sure we don't mess up too much LOL! \n\nPlease sign up today!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nAttempts to track down the SCP-8519 troop in Los Angeles along with Rosalina Sparks are currently underway.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum-2:** Interviews\n\nDuring April of 2021, the Foundation contained 5 instances of SCP-8519-A from different locations around the country. The instances were interviewed and tested. The Foundation told the parents of the SCP-8519-A instances the girls were invited to a special summer camp for the Sprinkle Scouts. Foundation agents posed as camp counselors for the interviews.\n\nBoth the girls and the parents were interviewed.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-8519-A-1\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher Sana Loo\n\n------\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Hello, Rebecca. How are you today?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** I’m doing good, ma’am. Can I get back to making cookies now?\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Soon. But first, can you remind me why it’s so important to make these cookies? \n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Yeah, of course ma'am! Troop leader Anisa always says we have to keep making as many cookies as possible so we can make happy as many people as possible! She says if I'm a good baker, my future husband will be so happy with me. People just get so happy when they eat their cookies and I love seeing more smiles on their faces!\n\n**Researcher Loo:**  So you're making all of these cookies because you want to?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Uh, duh! It's what makes me happy.\n\n//Researcher Loo sighs.//\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Did somebody tell you that it will make you happy? Or did you figure it out on your own?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Well, troop leader Anisa did. She said that's what KeeLee says. And she was right! It makes me really happy that I'm already making myself the perfect woman.\n\n**Researcher Loo:** How old are you, Rebecca?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** I’m 9, ma’am.\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Don’t you think it might be a bit early to be worrying about this kind of stuff? \n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Of course not! Troop leader Anisa-\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Rebecca, I’m asking what you think. \n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** It’s never too early to worry about those kind of things! I want to already be prepared to make my future husband happy!\n\n**Researcher Loo:** So you decided that all on your own? \n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Yep! But I really think I should get back to making cookies. I haven’t made my first batch yet and if I don’t sell 300 by the end of the week I might get kicked out! \n\n**Researcher Loo:** I was talking to Anisa earlier. She said you don’t need to make cookies this week, and she’ll tell you when you need to. \n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** What? But- I need to! I’ll never be happy if I don’t! If-if I don’t, then my future husband will hate me!\n\n**Researcher Loo:** He won’t. Missing one week won’t-\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** No! I can’t miss this week! You don’t understand! It- I mean nothing if I can’t serve cookies to people! I-I-\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Alright- tell you what. I’ll talk to her again and tell her how much you want to make cookies this week. Deal?\n\n//SCP-8519-A-1 pauses.//\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Yes ma’am. That was very rude of me. I won’t raise my voice again.\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Don’t worry about it. You’re fine! Just sit tight, alright?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Yes ma’am.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-8519-A-1,  SCP-8519-A-2\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher Sana Loo\n\n**Note:** Researcher Loo interviewed  SCP-8519-A-1 and  SCP-8519-A-2 after both had completed testing, both producing 600 cookies in 5 hours. \n\n------\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Hey you two! You did great work today! Mind if I sit down with you two for a moment to talk to you together?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Of course, ma’am! But can it be quick? We need to make more cookies. \n\n**SCP-8519-A-2:** Yeah! We still haven’t made enough! My mom would be disappointed we only made 200 when working as a group. \n\n**Researcher Loo:** Why is that? \n\n**SCP-8519-A-2:** She says a good wife should be able to make 500 a day if that’s what her husband wants.\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Is that what your dad expects of her? \n\n**SCP-8519-A-2:** I don’t think so. He says he doesn’t understand the whole Sprinkle Scouts thing. He’s happy that I’m ’acting better’. He doesn’t even know what JGT is. Well, he knows, but not many details. He just knows it’s where my mom met all her friends. \n\n**Researcher Loo:** What does he think of her friends?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-2:** He doesn’t know a lot about them. Mom is kinda secretive about her friends. \n\n**Researcher Loo:** What about your parents, Rebecca? \n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** My dad signed me up for the Sprinkle Scouts because he thought it might be good for me to have some girly influence in my life. I don’t have a mom.\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. Well you girls are doing a great job right now. Why do you think you’re able to make so many cookies every day? \n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** A lot of hard work. We want to follow in the footsteps of Rosalina! She’s happy and married with a daughter. Her daughter Molly is part of the troop in LA. I want to go there to meet her. She once produced 700 cookies in a day! \n\n**Researcher Loo:** Well me and the other counselors were talking about how you both are working so long so quickly. Do you think you're working too long on them?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-2:** Not at all ma'am. We're barely putting in nearly as much effort as we can. If we can make more cookies, why wouldn't we?\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Well we appreciate your effort sincerely. How about you two take a break to get something to eat?\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:**  But- we don't have time to eat! We haven't made our quota yet!\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Don't you think you will do better after eating? I think you will.\n\n**SCP-8519-A-1:** Well, I guess I’m supposed to listen to superiors.

I’m camp counselor Lily! I wanted to talk to you about your daughter, Paulette. Tell me, how did she find the Sprinkle Scouts?

She’s like, high school friends with Elizabeth, the sister of the founder. She signed up her daughter Annie, and said she’s been so much better! She has more friends, she’s more efficient, and much more obedient too! I thought that would be good for Paulette. She’s is also more obedient! She listens to everything Bob and I say haha.\n\n**Bob:** Yeah, she’s been great. It’s amazing the way she’s been making cookies. She barely even asks for things any more. She used to be so much brattier. \n\n**Researcher Loo:** Well I’m glad our group has been helpful! She’s had so much fun here at camp with the other girls! You know, it’s really great of you to decide upon this life path for your daughter! A very wise decision! \n\n**Calisa:** Oh, stop. We’ve always wanted what’s best for our daughter.\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Well Paulette has been such a joy at our camp. When did she join? \n\n**Calisa:** About 7 months ago! At first, she wasn’t quite as good at making cookies. She only made like, 30 boxes a day. Can you believe that? But her camp counselor Dollia assured me that she would get better through their lessons, and she did! \n\n//Calisa laughs.//\n\n**Calisa:** Well, did you just ask us here to ask us about her time here? What did you want to tell us about her?\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Oh nothing in particular. I just wanted to hear about her achievements from your end! \n\n**Calisa:** Understandable! She better be baking the right way, now! \n\n//Calisa laughs again.//\n\n**Researcher Loo:** Oh, she is! How much does she bake at home? \n\n**Calisa:** Oh, like a ton! She’s constantly baking those cookies! And if she’s not baking them, she’s selling them to people! One time she asked me for help, but I told her a good young lady is able to do things like baking without help! \n\n**Researcher Loo:** That is totally true! \n\n**Calisa:** I’m so proud of her and everything she’s accomplished. \n\n**Researcher Loo:** I am too!

They don't want to help you - they want to take away what makes you, //you// and replace it with what they think you should be.\n\n**SCP-8519-A-3:** Oh.\n\n**Researcher Loo:** They're not good people.

I am organizing for her and all other former members of the Sprinkle Scouts to undergo therapy. I am furthermore prohibiting testing their cookie-making abilities or any actions which encourage the girls to make cookies/reinforce what JGT manipulated them to think. Let's try to see if we can get through to the other victims of JGT, too.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum-3:** Incident 05/17/2021\n\nOn 05/12/2021, SCP foundation servers were down at Site-414, only one accessible screen being available on all devices for approximately one hour.
