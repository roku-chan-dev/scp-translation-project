The trio are engaged in conversation around a large punch bowl filled with a vaguely cream-coloured liquid in the centre of the table. The room is decorated with a series of shoddily prepared Christmas decorations consisting of vaguely-snowflake-shaped paper chains, strips of wrapping paper cut, twisted, and hung up in an attempt to replicate tinsel, and a small cactus that has been capped with a Santa Claus Hat. Tony is in the process of scooping the beverage within the bowl into a mug that reads \"Don't talk to me --until I've had my coffee!--\"]//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** So any of you see Vincent on the way in?  What's the deal with this anyhow?\n\n**Leonora Morales:** Not sure, but I passed by the kitchen and something in there smells like it's burning. This better be important, I had just got nestled in to watch a migratory colony of puffins coming in to roost. They've been cursed by the Fae Tyrant, Queen Mab to sing with the voices of the dead. What's the point of having a vacation form if we're just going to be called in anyway? \n\n**Tony Catalano:** It makes Vincent feel powerful.\n\n**Leonora Morales:** He better get this on with quick, those puffins are crepuscular. \n\n**Noah Patel:** Eww. \n\n**Leonora Morales:** Not what you think it means. How was JerseyDevilCon going? \n\n**Noah Patel:** It went well. We had our roundtable to present findings and then the annual DevilHunt. There were five of us still there when I left, which is a pretty good-sized crowd. The Jersey Devil didn't show up though. \n\n**Tony Catalano:** How would that have even happened?\n\n**Noah Patel:** We put flyers up. The Jersy Devil's in Jersey, hence the name, right? So it's bound to see them eventually. Although I suppose maybe it wouldn't be able to read English. We probably should have thought about that ahead of time. \n\n**Leonora Morales:** Noah, what exactly is it that you do?\n\n**Noah Patel:** Oh, all sorts of stuff. How was your day going, Tony?\n\n**Tony Catalano:** I'd say I can't complain, slept in, had brunch, but then I got a call from the in--\n\n//[Vincent Bohart enters the room with a candy cane stuck in his mouth. Seeing the assembled individuals, he inadvertently sucks inward, causing it to slide further in and obstruct his trachea. He quickly coughs, ejecting the candy cane onto the conference table.]//\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** What the hell are you people here for? \n\n**Tony Catalano:** You called us in. The emergency alert? We've all been waiting for you.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Oh, yeah. That's all been taken care of. False alarm. Great work everyone, very prompt response time and all that. \n\n**Leonora Morales:** Wait, what?! Vincent, I was planning that field trip for months! \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** I'll give you all an extra gold star on your performance reviews.\n\n**Tony Catalano:** So I've been sitting in rush hour traffic for an hour -- on one of the handful of vacation days we can take off -- for no reason? Vincent, I'm missing dinner with the in-laws for this! \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Hey, blame Atlantic City, or the electrician who installed the alarms. I knew the old system was fine. Do you know how much of our operational budget that costs us? \n\n**Tony Catalano:** Yes. I'm the one who does the budgets. Anyway, I'm not complaining. They were threatening to bring over ham and turkey meatloaf, like in the same log. Honestly, I'll toast to being here. \n\n//[Tony drinks from his mug, before coughing the thick liquid up]//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Newborn baby Jesus, what the fuck is this?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Eggnog.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** It's mostly rum though. The eggnog was expired. It helps with the taste. \n\n//[Tony Catalano pinches his nose and takes another gulp. Noah Patel proceeds to also scoop up some of the liquid into a glass.]//\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Not that I really care, but Noah should you be drinking that? Are you over 21? \n\n**Noah Patel:** I'm 32. \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Huh, really?\n\n**Noah Patel:** It said so on my birthday party invitation last month. I gave you the card.

I found that watch you had me looking for there.\n\n**Leonora Morels:** So this wasn't some elaborate ploy to lure us all here, under the guise of a containment breach -- which, I'm sure violates several Foundation codes -- to serve us whatever you've been cooking in a room that looks like it's been decorated by a kindergartener? \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** You think I'd want to spend //more// time with you people?\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Well, we're here now, and //I// don't intend to leave.

Conversation with the aforementioned individual, as well as other attempts to discern what is in the oven, have not yielded a definitive answer.
