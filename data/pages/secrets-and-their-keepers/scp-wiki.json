Still but a sapling nestled on the shores of a great river, this Library began to grow outwards and upwards, each new sensation a wind across its elastic bark limbs carved deep into the rings of its core; knowledge that would be called upon to name the sky, the ground, and the sea. But like any quest for knowledge, there is some storm to chase, some rainbow to seek the end of. The Library knew //want//, a thirst for knowledge. \n\nSo the Library left, wandered, and with it, the world spoke to fill its many branches and rings with its knowledge. The Library wandered for millennia, before finally settling down a few stars away from Polaris, nestled in the shadow of the Great Bear. Although it no longer wanders this world, roots of it spring throughout, small havens where it can share the knowledge of its many years. It is here that the memories of new life bloom upon its branches, babies taking their first breath and speaking to the grass, which is an old friend of the Library...\n[[/div]]\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a very clever child by the name of Matilda Moose. Much like the Library, Matilda had been born with an insatiable hunger for knowledge. Every tactile sensation and audible noise was wonderous to them as they crawled around on the carpet. Matilda's parents, who did their best to keep pace with their eager learner, collected all manner of book and story to share with their child. And so Matilda learned and learned and grew and grew, quickly exceeding their pre-kindergarten peers, and then benevolently dispensing their knowledge to all who asked curious questions on the colorful playgrounds. There was something appealing to Tilda about being a teacher, exchanging knowledge for new knowledge, scraps of ideas for irrefutable facts.\n\nAt the age of seven, Matilda saw their first magician at summer camp. The awkward man, dressed far too extravagantly for the summer's heat, pulled a white rabbit out of his raggedy top hat. Matilda sat stupefied; They hadn't the faintest idea how the man had done this, and were met with only hushes and shushes from the audience when they asked. Even after the show, the trick was all Matilda could think about. They replayed it over and over in their brain and got nowhere closer to the truth. When the man next returned to the camp, Matilda approached the magician and asked him how it was done. The man just laughed at them and said \"a magician never reveals his secrets!\"\n\nIt was then that Matilda decided they hated magicians.\n\nMatilda took the magician's retort to heart and vowed to learn all they could about magic, to never be made to feel lesser again. They read all the could, and practiced until they understood each mechanical part, each smoke and mirror that went into the trick. They lured a rabbit into a makeshift trap, a perfect volunteer for their first performance. \n\nAnd then, they showed others how it was done.\n\nBut... in-so-doing they learned something else: the thrill of fooling audiences, their amazed applause as Matilda flaunted their wit. The look in their eyes, both awe and excitement, as Matilda seemingly folded the world in front of them, drawing forth something from the depths of their imaginations. Once again, Matilda held in their hands the cards of knowledge, and continued to push forward to learn more tricks from the mundane to the mystical to chase that awe-filled high. \n\nCementing their new path, Tilda had become a magician.\n\n[[div class=\"picturebooksnake\"]]\n[[image \nhttp://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:stipulation/Pictorial_Key_to_the_Tarot_Wands_01.jpg]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWith roots sufficiently laid, Tilda grew, both physically and through the knowledge they possessed. Elementary, middle, and high school passed in a whirl, and Tilda was able to use the energy normally devoted to studies to learn more esoteric facets of knowledge. As a student, Tilda brought this same passion to learning all they could about all that they could. They still did the good work of teaching others what they knew, but ultimately they derived the most joy of knowing something others didn't, of their high grades, their academic awards, and all the other proofs of their cleverness. People looked up to Tilda being at the top of their class, and it was there that people trusted them with more than just grades: secrets. Those who know, know, and those that don't instead live in the dark. \n\n Humans were naturally inclined to fear of the dark, and what it represented: the unknown. Tilda, of course, was no different. But Tilda knew, if someone could recognize every distant shape, name every shadow - why, there would be no unknown to fear at all! Tilda used this steadfast conviction  as they maneuvered the remainder of their time in their high school's haughty cliques and neverending gossip. They were hungry for far more than AP Literature lectures and gossip about who was seeing who; Stagnation clawed at Tilda, only ending with diploma in hand and a bus ticket to somewhere new: college. \n\nThough college was meant as a fresh start, Tilda returned to their time-trusted routine, as if it were carved in their very bones. Here was a chance for them to learn about others from all over the world, to use those experiences to further Tilda's store of knowledge while they unknowingly fed into that praxic hunger. It was only natural that they would drift towards another like them: a girl in black who also spent her life among the pages of a book, a kindred soul, a friend, or perhaps something even more. A girl who promised them more knowledge than they could ever desire. Finally, Tilda had met an equal. \n\nThe pair spent nights combing through ancient texts, collecting secrets, distributing what they knew to the classmates they could trust. They spent hours across the study room or library from one another in silence, eyes feasting on the written knowledge shared within the college's great halls. In this silence, trust blossomed; a resource almost as valuable as knowledge in Tilda's eyes. \n\nIt was on one of these nights that the girl in black introduced Tilda to an even greater purpose, a choice to pull the unseen scales from Tilda's eyes so they could learn about the true nature of the world. The girl had amassed a collection of scraps of books, manuscripts, poems and art, written thoughts laid bare in ink. She explained to Tilda that these works told stories that the world //should// have forgotten, phantoms that existed only on the page now. The world didn't forget them, however, because the girl did not forget them. Tilda bubbled with anger at the thought of some unseen force trying to one up them, and, with promise made to the girl, the two unearthed stories that should have been long lost. \n\n[[div class=\"storybookforest\"]]\n...I walked along a hidden path in the woods one day, sitting next to a statue as if it were an old friend. \n\nThe statue was green with moss and lichen, and although it is a faux pas to reveal all of one's self to strangers, the marble chips and cracks allowed me to see into this inviting figure. I set down my bag and looked around. Scattered in the clearing's periphery lay its arms, viney limbs of toned muscles that became the home of those creeping isopods living beneath. I found its head leaning against a rotted log, pupil-less eyes and stoic countenance never softening even as a I rolled it back to the base of the statue. Finally, its spear lay splintered, but I placed its ornate head in the three-fingered hand of the stranger. \n\nWith all pieces returned, I found a tarnished plaque reading such:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\nHere lies [[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]The Ancient Guardian[[/span]]\n\n//Share and rejoice for his noble deeds;//\n//Saving the world from the Princess of weeds;//\n//Rest, rest, for the evil is beaten.//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]] \n\n\"Thanks for the story, old friend.\" \n\nI pat his shoulder, took a swig from my flask, and continued down the path, thinking back on the name \"[[span style=\"filter: blur(5px);\"]]The Ancient Guardian[[/span]]\". It wouldn't be long until it was once again forgotten, and the story left my mind as a I traveled down the path, wondering what other fantasies the forest would have in store...\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"middletext\"]]\nOne cannot take back a boot print in the mud,  nor could they uncrush the butterfly who led the pair to come across this archaic tale. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"storybookwhiz\"]]\nSo there used to be this dude in my home town. Some little old guy with frizzy hair who used to walk around with a big stick. I never knew his real name, but when I was a kid we all used to call him \"The Whiz\" since he used to do magic tricks. And because he smelled a bit like piss. Man everybody used to //love// the Whiz. I used to pass him an apple every time I walked by going home from school, and he'd do a little card trick or coin trick and make my day. One time I asked him to teach me, but he'd always just smile with a little twinkle in his eyes and say that a magician never reveals his secrets. A lot of us kids took that as a challenge, taught ourselves some tricks, but nobody could ever do it like the Whiz. Man, I would swear up and down this guy knew real magic! The one time I thought I figured out one of his tricks, pulling a coin out behind some kid's ear, easiest trick in the book, he just tilted his head and dozens of golden coins fell out, wayyyyy too many for him to have palmed. Turns out they were all chocolate, not gold. A real special memory, you know?\n\nWeirdest thing though. I flew the coop, went off to college, got a job and all that. Forgot all about magic until I found some old trick cards of mine. Asked about the Whiz when I called home that day, and everyone swore he was just an urban legend! Some collective hallucination or a childlike fantasy or some crap. Next time I went home, I looked around for the guy, no sign of him, just his old stick where he used to hang around.\n\nI don't know what happened to the guy, but it's fucked up what they did to the Whiz, I hope he's doing alright.\n\n= [[size larger]]♠[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"middletext\"]]\nA game of cards can only go on for so long, and a magician can only hold so many up his sleeve.

A profound feeling of sadness hung over the air, and Tilda looked to their companion for wisdom. \n\n\"In the Library, the most important rule is that something //must// be shared. That it must not be forgotten as long as there are still those that value knowledge in this world.\"\n\nIt was then that the girl revealed herself a storybook queen, a protector of the forgotten, and informed Tilda of her noble mission. What could Tilda do but answer her call? Take the Serpent's Hand? The studious and well-read who spent their time teaching others, not just the mundane knowledge of textbooks and seminars, but of truths lost to the ears of the many. Oh the things Tilda learned! They felt as if they had truly found a place they belonged, and they found that there were those that threatened that place. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYou see, //they've// always known there was a Library too, those book-burning fascists, those hoarders of knowledge, and they've always //hated//, always strived to prevent others from knowing. In fear they armed themselves with their clockwork propaganda machines, their perversions of cryptomancy, their hemlock cures to minds that have pondered more than //they// allow. All of them, deafening lies. They've cast the world in a veil of mundanity and forced us all to dance along wine-drunk to their sick masquerade. \n\nBut still, there is the Library.   \n\nThe Library stands far away from it all; an island of truths in an ocean of lies, a tree swaying among endless winds threatening to topple it and return it to the ground. It is here where we come to remember, despite the ceaseless crusade of jailors with the soulless purpose of pruning our memories to fit their hideously astroturfed Garden of Eden. Among the shelves in docents are what was and what is and what shall be, winding and unwinding threads of universes so similar yet so different to our own. It is here we reflect, for although their memories may be wiped from our minds, //they// will never succeed in wiping them from our stories.\n\nLong ago there was a snake in a Garden far away from here. Many remember the snake as a deceiver, a tempter, a liar, but we know it was none of those things. Knowledge was hidden from early humans, knowledge that would //make// them human, but forces that play god often nip imperfection in the bud before it can take root. All the snake offered was a choice: A choice for knowledge that would better connect the humans to the world around them, if only they disobeyed their creator and warden to grasp the freedom of choice in their hands. We make hundreds, if not thousands of choices everyday in an attempt to live what we feel are our best lives. The humans made their choice, they were punished, and the snake was cursed to crawl on its stomach ever since.\n\nWe reject their curse. We reject living on our stomachs under the boots of those in pursuit of some utopia of the mundane. \n\nAs long as there is knowledge to share, there will always be those that try to hide it and those that try to share it. The denial of knowledge is the denial of one's primal instinct of curiosity, a betrayal of our intuition. Every library must have books, every book an author, and every author a story to tell - through their words or their pens or their blood. When we find those who seek to challenge knowledge, to deny stories, we think back to our common ancestor and the choice they made. This time it's our turn to offer knowledge to those without, to simply offer a choice. If humanity is to ever overthrow the petty gods, the skittish bureaucrats and capitalists and zealots that try to play us as pawns in some pyrrhic game, they have to make a choice, they have to take the Serpent's Hand. \n\n[[=]]\n\nThis is who we are, and this is why we fight.\n\n##green|//~Tilda Moose//##\n\n[[div class=\"picturebooksnake\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/serpent-s-hand-hub/shlogo3---Cutout2.png ]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@ \n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"tillytext\"]]\nTilda closed their \"manifesto\" and stood, stretching deeply until their neck cracked.

The Wanderers' Library is a library of unknown size stated by many to be the largest repository of knowledge in the universe, with some claiming it contains the sum total of //all// knowledge in the multiverse. Although the Foundation has been aware of the Library since the inception of the organization, this awareness was due only to secondhand sources. It wasn't until Director Tilda Moose's defection from the Serpent's Hand to the Foundation that a more concrete understanding of the Library was obtained.\n\nThe Wanderers' Library is currently uncontainable, both due to the unknown amount of Ways leading to it as well as the resources required to theoretically anchor or sever Nx-01's connection to baseline reality. Instead, the Foundation's current objective is to mute the influence of Nx-01 by controlling the flow of information through the use of amnestics, disinformation campaigns, as well as monitoring staff and patrons that frequent known Ways. Patrons confirmed to originate outside of baseline reality are to be detained and interrogated for information pertaining to Nx-01. Although a comprehensive list of Ways is believed to be impossible, researchers have noted high fluctuations in Hume levels around university libraries, especially those primarily serving anomalous populations (See: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6342 Serena Verdae College]).\n\nLibrary staff, referred to as \"Librarians\", are split into three categories: Archivists, who relay and spread information from the Library to individuals beyond the extradimensional location, Custodians, responsible for the upkeep of Library facilities, and Seers, oracles that act as guides to patrons within the Library. It is currently unknown whether Librarians are hostile to the Foundation's mission due to inconsistent interactions with all three categories...\n[[/div]]\n\nThey did not miss the Hand, but it was no secret that Tilda missed the Library.

At least in the library they could rest and read a calm story, here there seemed to be nothing but consequences. There were no more stories about good triumphing over evil, brave heroes slaying monsters that threatened the light.

Access to the Wanderers' Library through the use of captured Serpent's Hand agents has yet to be achieved.\n[[/div]]\n\nFor all that the Library was a bastion of free knowledge, there were still locked doors, rules to follow. Mysteries for only the Serpent to know. Tilda thought back to their younger self at those magic shows, and couldn't help but feel a hatred bubbling within them. From the moment they'd learned about the Black Vault they'd felt a void, ##red| a hunger## within them, aching to taste this knowledge, taboo as it was.\n\nBut they knew that they'd never be able to safely study it, or in some cases even //remember// it. That was, until the gray man gave them the means to do so, and the knowledge of how to obtain it.\n\nThen the man let them go, not with a tracker, not with a mind wiping pill, but with an offer, an apple.\n\nAnd so Tilda ate of the forbidden fruit.\n\nA cold breeze cut through the room, causing Tilda to pull their sweater close. A chill of remembrance, albeit clouded by time and amnestics cut through them.\n\nWith their great sin committed, their hard-won knowledge gained, they were exiled from their paradise, never to return. But the Library would not steal the knowledge from Tilda's head, as doing so would be a betrayal of the very ideals it held. And so they left burdened with glorious knowledge, knowledge that only //they// knew and nobody else. \n\nForbidden knowledge they could exchange for a place that stood in opposition to everything they once believed in, a place that kept knowledge well within its manila and binary walls.\n\nWhile Tilda Moose hated magicians, they found incredible joy in being one.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[module rate]]\n\n------\n\n[[[shattered-love|  Shattered Love >>]]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Prismal, AstersQuill]]\n> **Filename:** blurry.picture.jpeg\n> **Name:** Teodor Axentowicz - Samotna w mieście 1887.jpg\n> **Author:** Teodor Axentowicz\n> **License:** CC 0 \n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Teodor_Axentowicz_-_Samotna_w_mie%C5%9Bcie_1887.jpg LINK]\n> **Additional Notes:** Face blurred by [[*user AstersQuill]]\n\n> **Filename:** Pictorial Key to the Tarot Wands 01.jpg\n> **Author:** Pamela Colman Smith\n> **License:** CC 0 \n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pictorial_Key_to_the_Tarot_Wands_01.jpg LINK]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
