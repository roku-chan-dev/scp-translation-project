Pursuit and observation of SCP-8089 is under the purview of former Site-278 Director L. Emile Bouquet, with assistance from former Site-278 Chief Security Officer Iseult Bodmall and MTF Eta-10 (See No Evil) and Iota-44 (Norman Invaders). SCP-8089 mainly resides in the United Kingdom but has been detected on the Navarren border between France and Spain, and may also reside in Germany, Ireland, Italy, and northern Portugal.\n\n**Description**: SCP-8089 refers to a chimerical entity originating in the Isle of Anglesey, Wales, United Kingdom. The entity naturally emits a cognitohazardous sensory field that prohibits nearly all perception of it. It does not affect auditory sensations, however, and has been described as sounding like a pack of baying hounds. Persons sharing direct familial history with former Site-278 Director Bouquet are able to fully perceive the entity, through methods currently unknown. Bouquet has described the creature as having the head and neck of a serpent, the body of a leopard, the haunches of a lion, and the feet of a deer, and estimates it to be three meters in length and one point five meters in height, with an unknown weight. It is hypothesized that if the entity goes for an extended period of time without being actively pursued, it will perish.\n\n**Addendum-1**: In the event of SCP-8089's neutralization or termination, Bouquet and his retinue are to resume their duties at a Site to be determined. In the event of Bouquet's passing, a successor to the study and pursuit of SCP-8089 is to be chosen at his discretion.\n\n**Addendum-2**:  Bouquet has supplied various audio logs, reports, and recordings to supplement SCP-8089 data, compiled and approved by acting Site-278 Director Offet.\n\n@@ @@\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Enclosed: A video record of Site-278 made prior to the events in question.

Bouquet//\n\nI've been with the Foundation for twenty-five years now. Worked my way from Junior Researcher at eighteen, all the way up to Director of Site-278 in Corsica. I think I've done all right for myself. We've lost a lot of good people, but who hasn't? We've spared the world more than a few dangerous anomalies, so that's something to be proud of. I only have one real regret...but I'd rather not get into that. It's personal.\n\nI suppose my story really began about three days or so after the drill. We had just passed our monthly quota and were admittedly a little more relaxed than we ought to have been, but I suppose we'd earned a little hubris. Well, we were certainly going to get our fair share of unexpected action. For the last several weeks, our local Mobile Task Force, Iota-44, the Norman Invaders, had been sweeping the country for rumors of a temporal anomaly. They hadn't been having much luck finding it, but they were committed with their reports. I remember getting the alert from Captain Cochon one day that his squad had information they wanted to share with me personally, so I made preparations and welcomed the team inside.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Enclosed**: an edited transcription of the described meeting, as recorded by an operative of Iota-44 who chooses to remain anonymous.\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n**Cochon**: Well, it's probably nothing. Renard heard some dogs barking in the distance.\n\n**Bouquet**: Dogs?\n\n**Renard**: Yes, sir, a large number of them. I just thought it was unusual since we were out in the middle of the countryside. I guess someone could have been taking them for a walk, but they'd have to be toting around a //lot// of dogs for them to sound like that.\n\n**Bouquet**: How many would you say there were?\n\n**Renard**: Hmm, somewhere between fifteen and twenty. They could've just as easily been a pack of strays.\n\n**Bouquet**: And that was the only incident that stood out?\n\n**Cochon**: Just for that day, sir. [ //Cochon borrows a cell phone from J.

This picture was the ghost of a past long forsaken, and I knew that nobody else in the world would believe me.\n\nNobody living, at any rate.\n\nI took a break to walk around, clear my head, and get something hot to drink.  In my perambulations, I began to think of my father. I thought about what a stranger the man had been to me, how little I had seen of him as I had grown up, how much of an obligation I must have been for him. He was never cruel or cross, but he usually treated me as less of a son and more of a duty, something he needed to do once a week because a judge told him. Sometimes we'd get along all right, but other times, we'd barely exchange a few sentences in the span of an hour. He rarely prodded too deeply into my life, and I rarely did the same. He had another family to attend to, and I suppose...I wasn't as much of a priority. Kind of messes a kid up a little when their parents do that.\n\nHe did have one obsession, though, and he shared it with me sometimes, whenever he was in the mood. I used to bring it up a lot when I was a boy, but I almost never mentioned it after I went off to university. It became embarrassing whenever he talked about it, like a part of him still wanted to treat me like a child even though I was studying for a PhD. He'd go on about his destiny, or the family legacy, and how he wanted me to pick it up for him when he got too old for it. He'd show me drawings, diagrams, coats-of-arms, maps, old manuscripts, sour books that stank of age... Normally I just tuned it out. Occasionally I'd humor him and get an earful, and then he'd prod me about getting married, having kids, keeping the tradition alive. I just dismissed him and said that my work kept me too busy for that sort of thing. Obviously I never went into detail about the kind of work I did -- I'd just say \"at the lab\" or \"at the university\", and give him some vague tidbits here and there. A few years ago, I resolved to tell him everything when the time was right, but...\n\nI finished my drink, disposed of it, and went back to work. As I studied the photograph again, I couldn't help but think to myself, \"Dad would have really gotten a kick out of this.\"  \n\nI contacted Cochon and asked if I could accompany him out in the field to investigate the area where those photos had been taken. He asked me how I was able to see something that nobody else could, but I brushed him off, muttering some halfhearted excuse about how I was more experienced with cognitohazards -- that I'd been trained to withstand them or something. He seemed to buy it -- the perks of being a Site Director, he assumed -- and said that as long as I knew how to use a gun and wasn't too proud to follow his orders, then I could tag along. I agreed to his terms, though admitted that my marksmanship was rusty. I then rather spuriously wondered if Bodmall could accompany me as well. We got into a little spat about bringing extra security on what had essentially been a fruitless venture, and he reminded me that Iota-44 was more than capable of doing their job. I must've hurt his pride a little, or maybe he sensed that I didn't fully trust him. In any case, since I was upper brass, I got my way in the end, and we added another member to the crew. Bodmall seemed as apprehensive as Cochon, but went along with it, and spared little expense in making fun of my request during the journey.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Enclosure**: an edited transcription of the described period, as recorded by the aforementioned anonymous operative of Iota-44.\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n**Bodmall**: What's the matter, boss?

My feet may as well have been the roots of a tree. I neither fought nor fled, but froze, a paragon of idiocy. In my flimsy defense, I've never seen any real action during my tenure, so to be confronted with it so abruptly was jarring.  I finally realized what Bodmall wanted me to do, however, and ran for my life. I hated leaving her and Iota-44 behind to deal with whatever had attacked us, but I was the only member of the group who wasn't expendable. My stomach churned with the sickness of adrenaline and cowardice as I bolted, muscles awakening after years of atrophy. I had been something of a sprinter in my youth and managed to account for myself before growing winded. My efforts took me to a thick, shaded forest, where I staggered and lurched, gasping helplessly, light-headed and dazed. I came across a little creek and recalled something about how water leads to civilization, and one should stick to it when one is lost, so I sat underneath a nearby tree and waited for my heart to stop hammering.\n\nIt was almost dead silent.\n\nAs my gasping calmed down, I checked my body for any injuries, finding myself whole and unhurt. As far as I knew, I was the only one who was safe -- or even alive. Bodmall was tough, but that injury she sustained concerned me -- and what about Cochon and his men? For that matter, who had attacked us, and why? The Foundation had a long list of enemies, so it could have been anybody. I convalesced in quandary for a long time. As I sat there by the bank, I heard a peculiar sound, and froze. Something was coming through the trees, heading straight for this same stream: something large, powerful, and inhuman. My body stiffened; I swallowed, waiting. And then...\n\nMy skin prickled and eyes widened in astonishment. It slithered through the trees with the grace of a swan, four heavy legs hewing the grassy underbrush, limbs swollen with predatory strength. Its head stretched out, brazenly scouring its surroundings with apex confidence, cold eyes glowing gold, a slender fork periodically darting from its mouth. I was aghast as I watched it crawl to the stream, leaning over, taking a drink. One of its eyes fixed on me, and I flinched with a terror and a thrill I had never known before. I met its stare in awe, gripped with suspense and disbelief, so paralyzed that I couldn't even shudder. Finally it raised its long scaly neck, higher and higher until it nearly resembled a tree. Thunder shattered the sky and broke the silence. We stared at each other for a moment longer, until the sky broke open with rain. With it came a human voice, distantly shouting. The creature looked away and slithered off, as mysteriously as it arrived, accompanied by the sound of baying dogs. I swallowed and sat there dazed in the downpour -- for how long, I couldn't say. Eventually I heard footsteps drawing near. I grabbed my sidearm and stood in a defiant panic, but it was only Bodmall.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Note**: The newest model of Foundation-issued microchips, supplied by a joint operation of Anderson Robotics and Prometheus Labs, allows the chip to link to visual and aural receptors via the nervous system, enabling recordings of everything field agents see and hear.

Just don't fall asleep on me.\n\n**Bodmall**: Oh, I'd never do that. \n\n[ //The sound of rain continues.// ]\n\n**Bouquet**: Tell me, Bodmall: how much do you know about Arthurian myth?\n\n**Bodmall**: You mean like the Sword in the Stone and all that? About as much as the average person, I'd say.\n\n**Bouquet**: Ah. Well.\n\n//This is a story that began sixteen-hundred years ago, after the fall of the Roman Empire, during the so-called Dark Ages. One day, a young King Arthur, who was out hunting, came to a forest, much like this one. His horse had grown so exhausted from the hunt that it fell over dead, and he asked a nearby woodsman for a new one. As he waited, he sat by a pool, but was stirred out of his thoughts as a great, dreadful creature approached. Before Arthur could make sense of what was going on, the creature retreated. A King came riding up just then, and introduced himself as Pellinore. He claimed that it was his destiny to hunt the creature Arthur had seen. The two of them didn't exactly get off on the right foot, as they dueled so fiercely that Pellinore broke the very sword that Arthur had pulled from the stone. Luckily, the two men became close friends later, and together they united much of Britain under Camelot. Unfortunately, during one of those battles, Pellinore killed Arthur's uncle, King Lot, sparking a family feud that would result in his death -- by Arthur's nephew Gawain, of all people.//\n\n//As for the beast, with Pellinore dead, it fell to his sons to pursue the creature, and their sons after them. Most versions of the Arthurian myth say that Sir Palomedes the Saracen picked up the quest, owing to his close relationship with Pellinore, and hunted it for the rest of his life. Scholars see the beast as an allegory of Palomedes's fruitless love for a Queen, whom he pined for but could never win. Others suggest the creature is symbolic of the chaos that would one day befall Camelot, as it was born of a taboo much the same way as Mordred, Arthur's son from his aunt, was, and that only by converting to Christianity could Palomedes be victorious. One rather obsessed lunatic even believed that the beast lives to this very day, and that only those from Pellinore's bloodline could hunt it, as that was their eternal destiny. Take from that what you will.//\n\n**Bouquet**: Anyway, it's only a story, no matter how you slice it.\n\n**Bodmall**: So what does that have to do with you seeing those tracks?\n\n**Bouquet**: [ //exhales deeply// ] Some other time.\n\n**Bodmall**: Oh come on, sir! You can't leave me hanging like that! You could at least...

Bodmall cautiously levels her rifle at the door and opens it. They both relax as they see Cochon on the other side. He is bruised, bleeding, disheveled, and gasping for air.// ]\n\n**Cochon**: Good, you're all right.

It was still raining, but all things considered, that was the least of our concerns. I gave Bodmall a silent stare before parting ways with her; her gaze was like burning iron, and she nodded as we shared our unspoken accord. My return to Site-278 was unremarkable.\n\nIt was late at night when I got back. My first priority was contacting the O5 Council and reporting on what had happened. I made myself some tea and typed up a summary of the day's events, whisking it away to several secretaries, who'd in turn forward the events to the Overseers. I didn't mentioned my encounter with the creature. I briefly wondered what sort of calamity would cause the Chaos Insurgency and Horizon Initiative to butt heads like that, but realized that this knowledge wouldn't really help me in my normal affairs, so I went back to work. I hit a wall thirty-five minutes in, worrying about Bodmall.\n\nThen I thought about my father.\n\n//Where's Emile? Where is my son?//\n\nNo, I told myself. Work comes first. I can't protect anybody by dawdling.\n\nIs that still your excuse, a voice in my head asked me. I forced myself to finish one more paper. My tea was gone, and I didn't feel like making more, so I decided to clear my head. I went to my private bathroom and washed my face, inadvertently staring into the mirror as I dried off. Obviously, I saw myself reflected back -- but there was also a bit of my father in that face, too. My mother always did hate how closely I resembled him, both in looks and mannerisms. Like that was ever my fault.\n\nI sighed. \"What now?\" I asked my reflection. \"Get back to work,\" I answered, \"simple as that.\"\n\n\"Oh? And then what? More work?\"\n\n\"I'm a Director now; I have responsibilities.\"\n\n\"That's always been your vanguard, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"I can't stop, can I?\"\n\n\"Not for anyone or anything, huh?\"  I sighed and squeezed my eyes shut. I must be losing my mind, I thought, talking to myself like this. I kept staring at the men in the mirror, though.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I wondered. I left the bathroom, shut the door, sat down, and worked for two solid hours. I noticed a reply from O5-11's secretary and opened it. The Overseer was \"interested\" in what I had experienced, and wanted to look into it further. They postulated that the area must have some religious significance for the Horizon Initiative to get involved, and promised to give me some details later. I replied back, adding that I'd have my own people do some digging. France and Corsica are saturated with religious history, dating back to the Celts and Vandals and Gauls and goodness knows who else. It could have been anything, so Site-278 would be very busy going forward. I got one final reply promising updates on Iota-44, with a \"good luck, well done, keep it up\" to cap it off. An hour later, shortly after midnight, I decided to turn in for the night and slipped into my private bunk. No going home for me today.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Audio Log 06 of Director Bouquet//\n\nAt first I didn't know I was dreaming, for the dreamer believes their world is real, and all sensations and experiences are real.

I came to my own realization slowly, even as I wandered through a thick mist, with a great blue sky above, passing underneath a rainbow archway. \n\nI was alone, and at first I thought I was walking on clouds. A large shape approached me, silent and gentle, almost indistinguishable from the billowing fog. It loomed over me, wisps of white smoke curling, formless yet distinct. I thought that it pointed at me, and then pointed at something else in the distance. The shape faded as I walked away from it, towards the area it had indicated. Another shape was there, long and thin, no less solid than its predecessor, and yet...  I waited patiently, though for what, or why, I couldn't say.\n\nThe first shape reappeared and was now definitely pointing at the second shape, which seemed to look at me. I reached out to touch it but it drew away. I retreated, and it followed me. I pursued it again, neither gaining nor losing it.

Apparently the Battle of Roncevaux Pass, where Charlemagne had met his greatest defeat, had been transported to the modern era, in the exact location where it had originally taken place. The events played out precisely as they had over thirteen-hundred years ago, with a Basque army attacking the king's rearguard, cutting them off and wiping them out. When the skirmish concluded, a period of some days passed before it repeated itself. The Horizon Initiative had wanted to lay claim to Durandal, Charlemagne's famous sword, as well as the king's champion, Roland, and even the king himself. The Chaos Insurgency had merely wanted to put an end to the temporal loop, likely as a token of goodwill towards the GOC. Why they suddenly wanted to get on the Coalition's good side was still unknown, though the Overseers hypothesized that a much grander joint operation was on the Insurgency's mind. This was clearly upsetting, but for the time being, the Foundation decided to remain neutral in the conflict, only quarantining the area away from the general public. Well, stranger things, I suppose. All this and a Questing Beast to consider.\n\nBodmall was returned to me three days after I received this news, and Iota-44 was given a week's leave before their next assignment. As my own gesture of goodwill, I offered to buy Cochon and his team a round at the pub of their choice, so I was fairly occupied one sordid evening. The next day, it was business as usual. I was still curious about the creature I had encountered, but wondered if it was wise to bring it up to the Overseers. A cognitohazard that only I could see? Sure, that doesn't sound suspicious at //all//. I decided to wait until the matter of the looping temporal anomaly was resolved before making any further moves -- after all, Site-278 was already busy with their normal affairs. Deep down I knew this was just my way of distancing myself from the matter, just as I had done so many times before. This whole affair was like a wound that kept opening, sometimes of my own volition, and I knew that if I didn't resolve it one way or another, I'd end up a derelict mess.\n\nBut it wasn't as though I could ask for anyone's advice. The only person who'd be of any help to me...\n\nI requested a brief leave of absence around the middle of the month, and was granted three days. Then I did the stupidest thing imaginable, and went back to the place where I had first encountered the creature. Any sign of it had long since faded. The fields were unmolested, the forest serene and aloof. The locals were more concerned with rumors of the \"ghostly battles\", and any sound of baying dogs came from pets or strays. I had lost it.\n\nOr maybe I had only been losing my mind, and had become trapped in delusions, consumed by guilt and regret after thinking about my father so much. Perhaps I had only imagined those tracks, and had envisioned a monster where there was none. Working with the Foundation messes with your mind in ways no hallucinogen could hope to match; perhaps I really did just need a break to cool off and unwind. Now that I was thinking a bit more clearly, I had to laugh a little. How silly, to think that a cognitohazard got to choose who could perceive it and who couldn't! I'd honestly appreciate that; we'd be able to understand more anomalies that way. I resolved to spend the rest of my days in peace and relaxation, forgetting my troubles for awhile.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Audio Log 08 of Director Bouquet//\n\nA few days after I returned, the situation in Roncevaux escalated: an invisible force had thrown itself into the fray, attacking people on both sides. As the Foundation didn't want the Veil of Secrecy to be torn down any more than it already was -- or just as likely, for the Global Occult Coalition to get involved and turn this into an ugly war -- they decided to finally intervene. Iota-44 would be joined by Eta-10, the team that specialized in cognitohazards, as well as Eta-77, who dealt with religious anomalies. I wasn't too surprised when Cochon requested my assistance in the endeavor. He must've felt that the sudden appearance of this new anomaly was related to the tracks that I had seen -- or else thought of me as a specialist. I guess that's what I get for making up little white lies, but I accepted his request. Something in the back of my mind told me that this was no coincidence.\n\nIn an unusual reversal, Cochon insisted that Bodmall accompany me, while I was hesitant. I felt that as head of security for Site-278, she didn't need to be involved in this any more. We already had plenty of backup, and while Bodmall was competent enough, this was something beyond her expertise. Apparently \"expertise\" is exactly why Cochon wanted her along. Not only had she been present for the initial investigation, but had worked alongside Iota-44 afterwards, and frankly, knew the situation between the Insurgency and Horizon better than anyone else coming into it, including me. It was still my say at the end, but I must admit, I had a considerable amount of bias as I acceded to his request.\n\nTogether our sizeable convoy drove through the French countryside, as Cochon and the Captains of Eta-10 and 77 convened to go over the plan. We'd send word to the Insurgency and Horizon of our arrival and make clear our intent. The Foundation would not become involved with the temporal anomaly, or the parties laying claim to it; they would only quietly slip in, steal away with the second anomaly, and deal with it on their own terms. Of course, none of us expected this plan to go smoothly, but order were orders -- and it was the best chance we had.\n\nThe message was sent. We didn't get a response.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Audio Log 09 of Director Bouquet//\n\nNone of us were expecting a warm welcome when we arrived.  Cochon warned us that the Insurgency and Horizon might forget about this latest threat and end up mowing us down instead. You'd think watching your people getting killed by an unseen entity would've endowed them with a bit of sense. I said as much; Cochon shrugged, spat, and grumbled something about human nature. Things got uncomfortably quiet after that. \n\nEventually he cleared his throat and informed me that I'd be with Eta-10, trying to root this problem out. Eta-77 and Iota-44 would be responsible for keeping everyone off our backs. We weren't there to fight, he emphasized, even though his eyes burned like hot coals: \"but you can damn well bet we'll retaliate if we have to.\"  I turned to the Captain of Eta-10, a woman named Mishima with a scar on her forehead, entrusting her with my life. She returned the favor by entrusting me with their success. No pressure. \n\nOur convoy halted about half a kilometer away from the main battle; I was given binoculars and told to scan around. All I saw were tanks, mechanical suits, armaments, foot soldiers, infantry, explosions, flashes of light, smoke, fire, mayhem. Occasionally I'd get a glimpse of a Basque platoon skirmishing with Frankish soldiers, antiquated cavalry charging, the glint of armor. My skin crawled with primeval pleasure as I heard Roland's horn sounding, and I had to restrain myself from joining the fray. I told Mishima what I saw.\n\n\"What about the second anomaly?\" she said.\n\n\"Nothing so far,\" I admitted. I continued my vigil, trying to pick up on anything unusual. I thought I saw something odd in the distance and had just looked away to alert Mishima when the chilling scream of a missile broke our stakeout. Voices screamed for us to take cover; Mishima tackled me to the ground, covering me from the blizzard of dust and mortar and flame. The impact was nowhere near our position but the shockwaves still rattled my bones and sent my ears ringing. I wondered if I'd choke again if ordered to retreat -- but I never got to find out, as Mishima screamed for us to hold our ground. An improvised barrier was put up and the Captain roared at me to get back to work. \"We find this thing and capture it //today//, ladies!\" she bellowed. Another missile fell out of the sky, closer to our position. The barriers held; my stomach and eardrums weren't so lucky. I glared hotly through the binoculars, trying to steady my shaky hands as the fighting drew closer to our position. Damn it, I thought, can't they take this somewhere else?\n\nIntermingled with the whistling and blaring artillery were the shouts and screams of the two adversary forces. I got so used to hearing this as I searched for our invisible prize that I didn't notice how loud they had gotten until  it burst into our encampment. Chaos Insurgents were scattering wildly, gurgling and choking on terror, their ranks broken and disorganized. I had half a second to take all this in before a monstrous shape dredged from ancient legend bounded across the battlefield, flattening two soldiers with its hooves, its neck coiled around a third, crushing them to death. Their blood seeped out like juice from a squeezed fruit; I covered my mouth lest I vomit -- or scream.  In a flash they were partways in the mouth of the monster, its scales undulating as it swallowed its prey whole. I could do nothing but stare, first in abject horror, then in wonder.\n\nEverything seemed to stand still in that instant. The fighting had broken, the screams silenced, the calamity put on hold, all so that I could behold the creature. It was the exact same chimera I had seen at the river, in my father's books, in the legends passed down for centuries. It was real, nakedly real, an aberration tearing down all the assurances and reasoning I had built up around me. It was my father, pointing at me. It was my past, brought into my present. It was a wound ripped open. It was my dread, and my desire. I couldn't move, or even think: I could only stare at it, just as it stared at me.\n\nI mechanically took a step forward. The Questing Beast shirked back.\n\nI took another step. It leaped away, not out of fright but defiance.\n\nI took one more step and was thrown to the ground. One of Mishima's people shielded my body as shrapnel tore through him.\n\n\"Did you find it?!\" Mishima shrieked. I was too stunned to do anything. When I looked up, the creature had run off. Its absence burst the dam.\n\n\"There!\" I called, my hand burrowing past my savior's bloody shoulder. \"It went that way!\"\n\n\"On me!\" Mishima called, rallying her forces. She had someone tend to the wounded man, told me not to worry about him, and followed me as I ran after the creature. The war kept up with us for what seemed like hours, every step a brush with death as we wove our way through hostile territory. We pressed on, heedless; I was insane with terror and awe and foolish desire. I found the Beast's tracks and took to them like a bloodhound. I became blind and deaf to the world, laser-focused, literally following in the footsteps of Pellinore, Palomedes, my ancestors, my father.\n\n//So did Sir Palomedes ever catch it?//\n//No... In fact, it's still running around to this day.//\n//Why hasn't anyone caught it yet?//\n//One day, you'll understand.//\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Audio Log 10 of Director Bouquet//\n\nThe tracks led us into a small ghost town, little more than a cluster of derelict structures. Mishima's people spread out and formed a perimeter, most of them armed with devices that could block, counter, or bypass cognitohazardous effects; a few even had Scranton Reality Anchors. Mishima and three of her people stayed with me as I resumed the hunt. We had a few close calls as I scurried under a brittle archway, or dashed across a weathered bridge, or skirted around a windmill that had toppled over diagonally. One of Mishima's people mentioned how Don Quixote had won a victory after all, which had me pause long enough to smile. Eventually we came to a long-disused cathedral, and fool that I was, I nearly rushed into my death. A shot fired off, impacting only a meter away from my feet. I jumped back and looked up at the steeple, seeing the glint of a sniper rifle in the broken stained glass. Mishima shouted for them to hold their fire and identified herself. The sniper opened up a comm channel, and my blood nearly froze as I recognized the voice on the other side.\n\n\"Sorry about that, Captain. Me and a few of the Invaders were driven here by the enemy. I...I'm glad I just used a warning shot. Please tell me I didn't almost kill Director Bouquet.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether to fire you or promote you, Bodmall,\" I shouted. She grumbled, cursing and apologizing. I told her to shut up and let us in. It took them awhile to remove the barricades; Bodmall had us take cover as she scared off several stray enemies. By the time the last of us slipped through, I had been handed a gun and fought off at least three Insurgents. Bodmall was aghast and pale as she locked eyes with me.\n\n\"You're never gonna let me live this down, are you?\" she said, tremulous. I told her to forget about it, there were more important concerns at stake, and quickly caught her up on the situation. She told me she hadn't seen anything out of the ordinary, aside from Basque pikemen chasing Frankish cavalry, and had only been holed up in this cathedral for about an hour. Mishima took a moment to radio the other Captains about the situation, ordering them to rendezvous with us. Once she finished her transmission, I asked her what the plan was. We could hide out here and wait, but we'd risk being discovered by the enemy, and the trail would grow cold by then, if it hadn't already. She decided to hold up for a few more minutes and had me climb to a higher vantage point to see if I could pick up where the trail went. Halfway up the first flight, I stumbled, as the cathedral was shattered by an explosion.\n\n\"Outside, on the double!\"  I heard Mishima rallying everyone as the cathedral shuddered. Parts of it were already collapsing. I had just enough time to get my bearings before a section of the roof fell, missing me by an arm's length. I coughed, stumbling around blindly, trying to keep my balance as the world tossed and tumbled below me. I made my way through an opening and took a moment to catch my breath. Mishima's people were vacating the area; I also saw Cochon's people mixed in, some returning fire at an unseen foe. I thought I had escaped the worst of it when I realized that Bodmall was no longer with us. I peered around to be sure, calling her name; it was then that I heard someone cursing and groaning from inside the cathedral. Panicking, I ran back inside and saw Bodmall rolling on the ground, knocked completely off balance. I made for her but was tossed about by another explosion. The roof finally collapsed, along with most of the walls. After that, I have no recollection: all I know is that I got out alive.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Enclosed**: an audiovisual feed transmitted from Director Bouquet's microchip implant.\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[ //Distant gunfire and shouts are heard, gradually growing quieter.

So was Lamerok -- aah, damn, that hurts -- was he supposed to go after it when his father was killed?\n\n**Bouquet**: I suppose. Either he or one of his brothers, Aglovale and Percival.

Anomaly (temporarily classified 278-G) currently uncontained, whereabouts unknown. \n\n[Update] Dir. Bouquet released, assigned to relocate anomaly #278-G. Eta-10 and Iota-44 assisting. Bouquet currently researching anomaly #278-G, first stop was the former domicile of his father. Took action to remove & amnesticize current residents. Confiscated a number of materials related to anomaly #278-G, i.e., books, maps, charts, accounts, etc. Present location: town of Langon, outside Bordeaux.\n\n[Update] Dir. Bouquet provided an SCP Document for anomaly #278-G, reclassifying it with Overseer approval.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"ENCLOSED\" hide=\"Close Document\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Item #:** SCP-8089\n\n**Object Class:** Uncontained\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** MTF Eta-10 (See No Evil) and Iota-44 (Norman Invaders) are currently assigned to locate and detain SCP-8089. Cooperation with Site-278 regarding this missive is ongoing. SCP-8089 mainly resides in the United Kingdom but has been detected on the Navarren border between France and Spain, and may also reside in Germany, Ireland, Italy, and northern Portugal.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8089 refers to a chimerical entity originating in the Isle of Anglesey, Wales, United Kingdom. The entity naturally emits a cognitohazardous sensory field that prohibits nearly all perception of it. It does not affect auditory sensations, however, and has been described as sounding like a pack of baying hounds. Persons sharing direct familial history with Site-278 Director Bouquet are able to fully perceive the entity, through methods currently unknown. Bouquet has described the creature as having the head and neck of a serpent, the body of a leopard, the haunches of a lion, and the feet of a deer, and estimates it to be three meters in length and one point five meters in height, with an unknown weight.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[Update] Dir. Bouquet's physical and mental well-being deteriorating, necessitating forced rest. Resumed study & pursuit two days later.\n\n[Update] Dir. Bouquet's physical and mental condition worsening. Sent request to O5 Council to abandon pursuit. Request denied. Contacted western European branches of Foundation for assistance.\n\n[Update] Dir. Bouquet's condition completely prohibits him from pursuing SCP-8089. Taken to Foundation hospital for physical examination. Residing doctor forwarded results to Overseer Council. Eta-10 and Iota-44 expanded search area using information gathered by Bouquet.\n\n[Update] Dir. Bouquet released one week later. Resumed pursuit into Spain & Portugal.\n\n[Update] Dir. Bouquet's condition critical. Sent second request to O5 Council to abandon pursuit. Request pending.\n\n[Update] Situation on Navarren border resolved in favor of C.I., Roncevaux anomaly presumed neutralized. Foundation diverted resources to studying the area, pursuit of SCP-8089 halted indefinitely. Dir. Bouquet recalled to Site-278.

Bodmall returned to Site-278 in good health and good spirits, and life went on as usual. We completed our drills, performed studies, contained anomalies, filled out paperwork, ate, slept, washed up, and did it all over again. It was...normal.\n\nAnd painful.\n\nI debated going out once my house arrest was lifted. There had been a betting pool among my coworkers on how long I'd last before I cracked and threw myself outside in hysterics to continue my mad quest. Nobody had wagered I'd last the entire time. I hung the chart in my office out of spite, or perhaps pride, and made sure to discipline everyone involved.

I'm Mr. Pot.\n\nThey had an escort drive me home the first time I went outside, and they were there to pick me up the next morning. I guess they still didn't trust me, even after I had served my time. I understand their line of thinking, but how could they understand mine? To even begin to comprehend what I was feeling, what I had experienced... But at times I barely understood it myself. As the days rolled by, I wondered if it really was some psychosomatic trick, the seed of insanity nurtured by my father's fancies and my sporadic, even prodigal relationship with him. To this day, a part of me wishes that I could've had a real relationship with him, that he had been there for me, cared about me, beyond his weekly two-hour visits. Had I //wanted// there to be a Questing Beast to stand in for him, and conjured it up out of pure need?

Uh, I don't know what to s--\n\n**O5-11**: One moment, now: I'm a realist, not a romantic. I expect regular progress reports. If you slip up, I'm recalling you, adding a demotion, and cancelling the endeavor. You'll take full responsibility for its termination. Is that clear?\n\n**Bouquet**: Yes sir, I understand, sir. Thank you, sir.\n\n**O5-11**: Good. Cochon, Mishima, I'll leave the matter of his retinue to your discretion. I expect the first report within six days, Bouquet. You're all dismissed.\n\n**Cochon and Mishima**: Yes, sir. [they log off]\n\n**O5-11**: Oh, before you head off, Bouquet, there's one more thing I'd like to add.\n\n**Bouquet**: Sir?\n\n[ //silence// ]\n\n**O5-11**: Just remember: no one in the world ever gets what they want. Happy hunting.\n\n**Bouquet**: Thank you, sir.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe room was small, but it would suit them well for tonight. They each had a bed and a little privacy, and all the world before them tomorrow. Lamerok looked out the window, smiling at the countryside. For a moment, he imagined he saw his father in the distance, proud and strong, saddled on a mighty steed, a banner waving in the breeze as he thrust at the sky with a lance, shouting //Tally-ho// with all his joy.\n\n\"Nice view.\"\n\nHe turned around, watching as Iseult closed her laptop and stood next to him. He looked outside and the image was gone.\n\n\"Yes,\" he whispered, \"it is. Finished sending the report?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Not much to say, though.\"\n\n\"Well, we've only been at it for a week. The Beast never made it easy for Sir Palomedes, either.\" Lamerok sighed, sat down on his bed, and opened a packet of headache pills. He took one and rubbed his temples. \"But what a week. Leaving Site-278, flying all the way to England, driving for nine hours straight...\"\n\n\"Thanks for making me do that, by the way,\" Iseult grumbled. Lamerok grinned.\n\n\"You're welcome. But three false trails, hours wandering around rough terrain, constant rain, missing more meals than I can count -- or showers! Oh, and let's not forget: one of us had to put up with Renalt and Shimada for a whole day, //while// nursing a three-day headache, on top of an upset stomach, with a report to compose that our jobs depend on...\"\n\n\"And me without my Stradivarius,\" Iseult chuckled, as she mimicked playing a violin. Lamerok feigned amusement.\n\n\"Not exactly 'happily ever after', is it? If I had known this would cause me so much trouble, I wouldn't have gone through with it. No wonder nobody's ever caught this thing.\"  Iseult smiled, sat down next to him, and placed her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Yeah, but it hasn't been all bad. Has it?\"\n\nHe smiled softly, and touched her hand.\n\n\"No.\" He looked up, glancing out the window again. Renalt and Shimada would be scouting the area for another hour, at least. Plenty of time to be alone.\n\n\"Want to hear a secret?\" he whispered. Iseult's eyes glistened.\n\n\"Always.\"\n\n\"I wasn't completely up front with O5-11 during our meeting. Well, that sounds awful: I really only omitted a minor incident. When my escorts came to retrieve me, I asked them to give me a moment with my father. I figured it might be the last time I'd be able to visit his grave, so... Anyway, I told him that I forgave him for everything -- for every wrong he may have done to me. Then I asked for him to forgive me of the same. I don't personally believe in an afterlife, but I'd like to think that he heard me, wherever he is.\"\n\nLamerok dabbed at his eyes while Iseult sat in respectful silence.\n\n\"So!\" he exclaimed after a moment. \"Where to next? I was thinking we could go to Wales. You've got family there, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, just my mother.\"\n\n\"You think you might visit her?\"\n\n\"What?\" she snorted, nervously laughing as she parted her hair back. \"And bring you with me?\"\n\n\"Why not? The Questing Beast first came from Wales, or so my father's research says. Two birds, one stone.\" Lamerok shrugged, smiling. Iseult turned away shyly.\n\n\"She…she might get the wrong impression. About you.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't have to meet her,\" he said softly. \"We can each do our own thing for awhile.\"\n\nIseult continued averting her gaze, hoping that Lamerok couldn't see her face.\n\n\"Yeah, maybe. But business first.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" he agreed. \"Oh, before I forget: a memento of our adventures.\"\n\nLamerok reached over, opened the bedside table, and presented her with a small box. She stared at it with some incredulity before opening it. Inside was a silver chain, inexpensive and plain.\n\n\"I have my own,\" he said, somewhat proudly. He lifted it up partways, squeezing his thumb and forefinger against something. \"When the Questing Beast left, I noticed it had dropped a few of its scales. I took two of them as a souvenir and made them into a necklace. Go on, put it on.\"\n\nIseult stared. She couldn't see the scales.\n\n\"Jewelry isn't exactly my thing.\" She added, with a stilted laugh, \"You couldn't find a scented candle?\"\n\n\"Sorry, our friend wasn't that considerate.\" He smiled warmly, and she, not wanting to appear ungrateful, looped it around her neck.\n\n\"How does it look?\" she said anxiously. Lamerok pursed his lips, holding his chin in appraisal.\n\n\"Hmm, you're right: jewelry doesn't suit you. But it doesn't suit me, either, yet here I am.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I guess I'm keeping it, then!\" He sighed with relief and smiled sadly.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I know you can't see it. It probably just looks like any ordinary necklace.\"\n\n\"No, it's fine,\" she said, beaming with joy, fighting to suppress her tears. She clutched the chain in her fist, and for a fleeting moment, thought she felt something smooth and circular yielding to her grip. \n\n\"I know it's there.\"\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8088]]] | SCP-8089 | [[[SCP-8090]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:scp-offices-sigma]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8089/Arthur_and_the_Questing_Beast_%28full%29.jpg\n> **Name:** Arthur and the Questing Beast\n> **Author:** Henry Justice Ford\n> **License:** CC0 Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arthur_and_the_Questing_Beast_%28full%29.jpg]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
