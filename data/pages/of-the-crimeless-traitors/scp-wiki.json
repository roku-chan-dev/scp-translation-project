long-passed\nthe world was into conflict cast\nThe War of Flesh, as it's now known\non its sides, factions two alone:\n\nIn one camp -- [[[scp-2406|titans tall as sky]]]\ntheir burning ANSWERS to deny\nheretic calls the world then held\none leader to [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|his men]]] compelled\n \nTheir enemies -- those brave with will\nOnce [[[sarkicism-hub|slaves with fearless faith instilled]]]\nthat rose from shackles, led by One\nand four Saints that were ruled by none\n\nIn chaos, one can hardly find\na man that truly kept their mind\nBut one of [[[scp-2095|Gyaros]]] found his chance\nby skill alone he held his stance\n\nThough sealed in cells as dark as night\nhe got to live, a newfound right\n\n**II.**\n\nThe man was young, and skilled like few\nhis voice a rule, his magic true\nHis warden -- rare and pure of soul\nthrough day and night, she would patrol\n\nhis cell and watch the man within\nher metal frame bereft of skin\nMetal plates and gears formed her bones\nShe'd guard the man in flesh-like robes\n\nThey eyed each other, through and through\nand over time each of their crew's\norders so questioned in the night:\n\"How can this be so just and right?\"\n\nFor the two were merely recruits\nby the war itself made half-brutes\nSo to oppose what they were told\nwas in their nature brave and bold\n\nWhen passing time made neither free\nthe man said: \"Run away with me\"\n\n**III.**\n\nShe raised a brow (\"Was this a plot?\")\nbut took the hand of who she caught\nand with slight fear went where she'd please\nto embrace the Nälkän breeze\n\nIt was a shock, to see so close\nthe men that anger past provoke\nAnd though they varied widely still\nthey were not men that she could kill\n\nThe men within were young and old\nand unalike all she'd been told\nin godlessness, they lay unbound\nin rule of will, they beauty found\n\nShe turned towards her new-made friend\nand -- forcing her worldview to bend --\nshe offered him the gift of choice\nfor him to listen to her voice\n\nAnd so, shrouded in careful trust\nhe left home to embrace her rust\n\n**IV.**\n\nOn far horizon he then found\na fortress with coherence bound \nwhere men and women like gears turned \nIn this dance, of their god they learned\n\nWhere reason always reigned supreme\nthey had no king and had no queen\njust laws of god they need abide\nas taught by prophets in loud pride\n\nThe young man gasped, for what he saw\nwas nothing like he'd known as law\nHe'd always thought young they did kill\nyet they had merely wills of steel\n\nthat so in knowledge widely grew\nand made of chaos logic due\nHe saw so much he never dreamt;\nshock to his heart a message sent\n\nBut time was up, that they both knew\nThey headed back with new taboos\n\n**V.**\n\nNext months pretending they both spend\nas if no such event occurred\nBut after many sleepless nights\nthe Nälkä said: \"This is not right\n\nI can no longer like this do\nand therefore I must ask: can you?\"\nShe closed her eyes, and focused deep:\n\"I hear them every night in sleep\n\nTheir beast-like screams, kids thrown as bate\nI think -- I want to meet this fate?\nThe answer's no, and break the wheel\nwe just must for once and real\"\n\nHe moved his head with hope in eyes\nhis soul and words just simply wise:\n\"Then let's together out there go\nto tell the world of what we know\"\n\nAnd so, though the two made no crime\nthey were now traitors of their time\n\n**VI.**\n\nThey went away so far and wide\nbut never once did they decide\nto turn their way back to their homes\neven though they gave up their thrones\n\nIn alone time shared love they found\nWith no-one but themselves around\nin years alive, they old did grow\nstill remembering years ago\n\nBut the world them remembered, too\nand warlords knew exactly who\nran away in the past long gone\nAnd in anger forth their swords drawn\n\nThey tried to run, they tried to hide;\nno-one could understand their side\nIn mutual unbroken care\nthey still were for each other there\n\nAnd even when darkness them took\nnot once did they regret their book\n\n**VII.**\n\nBut ages pass, and so do lives\nand their love too abides said rights\nHence millennia later two\nnone of the lovers still ensue\n\nThey both fought well, they both fought brave\nbut nature takes what it once gave\nPierced by flesh swords and vibrant spears\nthey faded into empty tears\n\nSo thanks to hate and thanks to time\nthe everlasting lay divine\nin crypts below an unchanged world\nin loving arms so gently curled\n\nNo sound to hear, no light to see\na promise empty to be free\nfulfilled in death and nothing more\nas cogs and flesh [[[memoria-adytum|wage final war]]]\n\nAnd there they lay, within the deep\nuntill Ion
