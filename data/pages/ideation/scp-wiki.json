  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n**HERE ARE SOME IDEAS ABOUT IDEAS.**\nFirst, some axioms.\n\n**Do not start writing until you have finished conceptual development.\nDo not assume that your idea is finished.**\n\nThere is **no such thing as a finished idea**.\nTo pursue the total completion and perfection of ideas is **madness**.\n//(This would take forever, and you don't have that long.)//\nWe must settle instead for **good ideas**.\nBad ideas are **unacceptable**.\nThis essay will teach you how to turn **bad ideas** into **good ideas**.\n\nIt is **very easy** to make **bad ideas** out of nothing.\nThis essay will explain **how to make good ideas out of bad ideas**.\nThis means you can make **good ideas out of nothing**.\n//(Which tends to be very useful.)//\nOnce you understand the process, **you will never run out of ideas**.\n\nThis essay is written all **zen-like**, because it is **amusing**.\nIt also helps to make it out of **easy to understand chunks**.\n//(There are no hidden koans, I promise.)//\nIt makes sense anyway, since **thinking of ideas is a kind of meditation**.\n//(Maybe assume the lotus position while reading, if you want.)//\n\n-----\n\n**What is a bad idea?**\n**What is a good idea?**\nWe need to know before we start.\n\nA bad idea can be **too simple** or **too complex**.\nA bad idea can be **too derivative**.\nA bad idea can be **conceptually incoherent**.\nA bad idea is **always at least one of these things**.\nThe worst ideas are **all of these things**.\n\nA good idea is **as complex as it needs to be**.\nA good idea can be original or derivative, but **original is better**.\nA good idea is **conceptually cohesive**.\nA good idea is **always at least one of these things**.\nThe best ideas are **all of these things**.\n\n-----\n\n**How do we construct a good idea?**\nFrom the ground up.\n//(Do not build a roof before you have walls.)//\n\nFirst, **start with some simple ideas**.\nA simple idea can be **entirely defined by one word**.\n//(Or maybe two.)//\n**It is very easy to find simple ideas.**\nIf you are having trouble, **open a dictionary**.\nPick a word at random.\n\nHere are **some examples** of simple ideas.\n**Birds.\nTrees.\nCarpentry.\nHappiness.\nPain.\nSpin.**\n\nThe first three of these ideas are **physical**.\nPhysical ideas are **more specific**.\nThey correspond to **particular things**.\nThe last three of these ideas are **abstract**.\nAbstract ideas are **less specific**.\nThey correspond to **general things**.\n//(There is a continuum here - but try to categorise anyway.)//\n\n-----\n\nNow, combine **one abstract** and **one physical** idea.\nThis constructs a **compound idea**.\n\nHere are some **combinations of our simple ideas**.\n**Spin birds.\nHappiness carpentry.\nPain trees.**\n\nHere are **some other compound ideas**.\n**Computer decay.\nMedical worms.\nCleaning dog.**\n\nSome compound ideas might seem **very silly**.\nDon't worry about it.\n//(Deep down inside, all ideas are very silly.)//\n\n-----\n\nOnce you have a compound idea, you must create a **concrete idea**.\nA concrete idea turns your compound idea into **exactly one sentence**.\nThis sentence is a description of a **particular thing**.\nIt should be **very short**.\n\nHere are some concrete ideas developed from our compound ideas.\n**Birds which fly by spinning.\nA type of carpentry which makes people happy.\nTrees which cause people pain.\nA computer which causes decay.\nWorms which serve a purpose in medical treatment.\nA dog which cleans things.**\n\nThere are many possible concrete ideas from each compound idea.\nHere are some alternatives to what we came up with before.\n**Birds which provide political spin.\nTrees which experience pain themselves.\nWorms that are trained medical professionals.**\n\nPick the one that **seems the most interesting!**\n\n-----\n\nOnce you have a concrete idea, you must **develop the idea**.\nThe concrete idea **acts as a seed** for further thinking.\nYour concrete idea **should not change too much from now on**.\n//(Unless your conceptual development finds a better one.)//\n\nA well-developed concrete idea becomes a **cohesive idea**.\nA cohesive idea **contains more detail than a concrete idea**.\n\nA concrete idea is a **summary in a sentence**.\nA cohesive idea is a **summary in a paragraph**.\n//(Or maybe more.)//\n\nA cohesive idea must contain detail which **flows from the concrete idea**.\nTo do this, we perform **conceptual expansion**.\nA cohesive idea should contain **no needless detail**.\nTo do this, we perform **conceptual contraction**.\n\nThink of your idea as being a **blob of clay**.\nYou are trying to make that clay into **a nice shape**.\n\nYou might not know what shape it should be at the start.\nYou might only discover the shape it should be while playing with the conceptual clay.\nYou might have a shape in your head, but think of a better one while playing.\n**This is good!**\n**Exploration and discovery are what make coming up with ideas fun.**\n\n**What can you do to shape your clay?**\nYou can **add clay**.\n//(This is conceptual expansion.)//\nOr you can **carve it away**.\n//(This is conceptual contraction.)//\nTo shape your clay well, **you will need to know how to do both**.\n\n-----\n\nThere are two paths for conceptual expansion:\n**Expand based on the abstract intentions of the idea.**\n**Expand based on the physical form of the idea.**\n\nThere are two paths for conceptual contraction:\n**Remove weaker concepts which are obscuring the stronger concepts.**\n**Remove concepts which do not match the abstract intentions of the work.**\n\nThese are the only things you should be doing for conceptual development.\n\n-----\n\n**How do we expand based on the abstract intentions of an idea?**\nWe will want to **think of new things that serve our objectives**.\nThis is especially important, so I will say it again.\nYou must add new things **that serve your objectives**.\n\nTo do this, we must **identify our objectives**.\nFortunately, as authors, we get to **define our own objectives**.\nSo you might already know what your objectives are.\n\nConsider as an example: **Trees which experience pain.**\n**How should a reader react to this?**\nA reader might be **uncomfortable** with the idea.\nBut why?\n\nThe tree can **experience pain**, but trees **cannot move**.\nIf a person is injured and in pain, they can **treat their wounds** or **see a doctor**.\nA tree **cannot treat its wounds**.\nA tree **cannot see a doctor**.\nA tree **cannot cry for help**.\n\nThese relate to **universal human characteristics and emotions**.\nThese are things which are generally true of any human being.\nPeople **enjoy** the **power** to control their own bodies.\nPeople **enjoy** the **security** of guaranteed help.\nPeople **dislike experiencing or witnessing pain**.\nPeople **dislike graphic images of human injuries**.\n\nThese are general facts about human beings.\n//(They might not be true for all people, but certainly true for most.)//\nThey elicit **stronger responses by their combination**.\nPeople fear not having the autonomy to alleviate their own pain.\nPeople fear insecurity and uncertainty in their future.\nPeople are **unnerved** by thinking about these things.\nWe can therefore pick as our objective: **unnerve the reader**.\nWe know how we must do this: **base our direction around universal human characteristics**.\n\nWe should think of some particular ways we can unnerve the reader.\n\nWe know that people **dislike being unable to control their own bodies**.\nThis is because they currently are able to do so.\nAt its core, this is a **fear of disempowerment**.\nTo effectively play off this, the tree **should have been able to move in the past**.\nThis initially empowers the tree, and then removes its abilities.\nPerhaps young trees **can move their limbs around**.\nPerhaps older trees have their bark stiffen **and can no longer move**.\n\nThis is also effective because it is **analogous to human ageing**.\nYoung humans are able to move around **freely and quickly**.\nOlder humans become **frail and infirm**.\nThe **fear of ageing** is primarily due to disempowerment in this fashion as well.\n\nFor humans, **ageing is terminated by death**.\nTrees can **live for hundreds of years**.\nPerhaps the trees can move for ten years, and are then **trapped for the rest of their life**.\nImmobile and stuck within dry, solid bark.\nUnable to move at all.\nBlind to the world around them.\n**Driven mad by boredom and loneliness.**\n**Incapable of screaming.**\n\nThis effectively **inverts the fear of death** into a **fear of a perpetual life in discomfort**.\nIt can be effective to take a universal human fear and **find how the inverse can also be scary**.\nIt is scary to be alone at night.\nCan we elicit fear from being trapped in pressing crowds of people under the blistering sun?\nOf course we can.\n\nAnother example.\n\nWe know that people **dislike graphic images of human injuries**.\nWe might want the reader to **feel empathy towards an image of a mangled tree**.\nIf they understand the tree to be experiencing pain, **this is horrifying**.\nThe tree is in **immense pain** and **cannot do anything to help itself**.\nBy analogy, the mangled tree is like a mangled human body.\nBut looking at a smashed up tree, a reader does not feel empathy towards the tree.\nTo make this effective, you must act to **establish empathy** in the reader.\n\nThis is how to expand based on the abstract intentions of an idea.\n**Use human universals.**\n\n-----\n\n**How do we expand based on the physical form of an idea?**\nWe will want to **interrogate the concrete idea**.\nThis is especially important, so I will say it again.\nYou must **interrogate** your idea.\n\nConsider as an example: **Worms which serve a purpose in medical treatment.**\nHow is **medicine** connected to **worms**?\nThere are many kinds of **parasitic worms** in the natural world.\n**Tapeworms** are a parasite which reside in the digestive tract.\nThey have historically been used to **induce weight loss**.\nAnother species of worm, **leeches**, were historically used for **bloodletting**.\nTheir saliva contains **anticoagulants, vasodilators, and anaesthetics**.\n\nMore broadly, what relations do other worm-like things have in medicine?\nLet's think about other animals with no arms or legs.\n**Snakes** are related from being on the **Rod of Asclepius**.\n**Maggots** can be used to **remove necrotic tissue** in a wound.\n\nWhat if we had a worm that could do **all of these things?**\nIt can be used for **weight loss** if inserted in the digestive tract.\nIt can be used for **bloodletting, anaesthesia, and sedation** if pressed against the skin.\nIt can be used for **removing necrotic tissue** around a wound.\nAnd it wasn't a snake on the Rod of Asclepius - **it was this worm!**\nWe now have a worm which would be very useful to ancient medical doctors.\n\nAll of these expansions came from **interrogating the idea**.\nAll of our answers were **conceptually related to the original idea**.\nThis means that **every part of the idea is related**.\nThis makes the idea **more complex** while **staying conceptually coherent**.\n\nWe will continue our interrogation.\n\n**Why does the Foundation hide the existence of this worm from the world?**\nThe worm serves a medical purpose but is being kept secret.\nAgain, we will look to related questions to find possible answers:\n**Why are real world medical tools kept restricted?**\n\nSometimes they are **potentially dangerous**.\nMaybe the worm's sedative is **powerful enough to knock people out**.\nMaybe this is how it hunts its prey in the wild?\n\nSometimes they are **extremely addictive**.\nMaybe those exposed to the worm will later **suffer extreme withdrawal symptoms**.\nMaybe this keeps its host dependent on it?\n\nSometimes there are **unusual side effects**.\nMaybe the worm **lays its eggs inside the host** after eating dead flesh.\nMaybe this is how it reproduces?\n\nThe answers to our questions **lead to more questions**.\n**The more questions you answer, the more complex your idea will get.**\nBy asking relevant questions, you will get relevant answers.\nBecause of this, the concept as a whole will be **very coherent**.\nInterrogating a **bad idea** can help to turn it into a **good idea**.\nYou just need to know the right questions to ask, and give good answers.\n\nThis is how to expand based on the physical form of an idea.\n**Interrogation**.\n\n-----\n\nThese two techniques are how you **expand an idea**.\nIt is **more important to expand an idea** than to contract it.\nThese techniques show how to **expand in the right way**.\nOur contraction techniques **fix problems from expanding in the wrong way**.\n\n**The wrong way is adding things at random.**\nThis is what a lot of people do.\n**Don't do this!**\n\nWe will very briefly go over the contraction techniques.\n\n-----\n\n**How do we remove weaker concepts which are obscuring the stronger concepts?**\nWe will want to **identify the difference between weak and strong concepts**.\nThis is pretty important, so I will say it again.\nYou must **know what makes a concept strong or weak**.\n\nA **strong concept** is conceptually linked to many other parts of your idea.\nA **weak concept** is conceptually disconnected from the other parts of your idea.\n\nConsider as an example:\n**A computer which can magically levitate that has an aggressive AI on it.**\nThis idea is actually **two component ideas**:\n**A computer which can magically levitate**, and\n**A computer that has an aggressive AI on it**.\nThe second idea is better than the first, since it is more strongly conceptually connected.\nAs such, the idea would probably be improved by **not having the computer levitate**.\n\nAnother example:\n**A man that can teleport and fly and read minds and can see through walls.**\nThis idea has **too many constituent concepts**.\nIt would be better to include just **one or two of them**.\nThis lets us better focus on expanding those concepts in particular.\n//(This is why most superheroes only have one or two superpowers.)//\n\nThis is how to stop weaker concepts from obscuring stronger concepts.\n**Remove or improve disconnected ideas.**\n-----\n\n**How do we remove concepts which do not match the abstract intentions of the work?**\nWe will want to **identify the abstract intentions of our work**.\nThis is especially important, but you already know how to do it from before.\nSo I don't think I need to say it again.\n\nConsider as an example: **A purple dog which kills people that it sees.**\nWhy does the dog need to be purple?\nDoes this help improve the idea at all?\nIt does not.\n**Do not make your dogs purple for no reason.**\n//(And killing people it sees is quite boring, too.)//\n\nAnother example: **A box which gives people hallucinations when they touch it.**\nWhy does the object need to be a box?\nIf we replaced the box with something more specific, would the idea be better?\nIt would.\n**Do not use generic objects when you can use particular ones.**\n\nYou might keep some detail which does not build towards the intentions of the work.\nThis should not be done for no reason at all:\nIt should **help to ground the idea**.\n**Detail is what anchors abstract ideas.**\nThe important thing is to **only include relevant detail**.\n\nThis is how to remove concepts not matching your abstract intentions.\n**Discard details which are irrelevant to your goals.**\n-----\n\n**Play off universal human emotions.**\n**Interrogate your ideas.**\n**Remove or improve disconnected ideas.**\n**Discard irrelevant details.**\n\n**This is all you need to know about having good ideas.**\n\n-----\n\nThere are some **secret advanced techniques!**\n\nMaybe try combining **three simple ideas** into your compound one?\nTwo physical and one abstract?\nTwo abstract and one physical?\nMaybe more?\nThis gives you **more options for concrete ideas**.\n//(Don't use too many, or it can get too complicated early on.)//\n\nMaybe try using **multiple concrete ideas from the same compound idea**?\nA bird which spins while flying **and** provides political spin?\nA tree which causes **and** experiences pain?\nWorms which are both a medical treatment **and** themselves medical professionals?\nThis gives you a **larger, thematically coherent concrete idea**.\n\nPerhaps you already have a completed idea.\nMaybe try **going backwards through these steps to simplify it**?\nYou could work your way **all the way down to your simple ideas**.\nThen you can work your way through the procedure again -\nYou might end up with a **totally different idea!**\n\n-----\n\nHere is a **collaborative exercise for the reader!**\n//(We will do this on the comment page.)//\n\nIn top level comments, include **three physical and three abstract simple ideas**.\n//(In addition to anything else you might want to say.)//\nIn replies to these, combine pairs of simple ideas into **compound ideas**.\nThen provide one or more **concrete ideas** for each compound idea.\n//(Point out ones that you find interesting - or which might be a particular challenge!)//\nIn replies to //those//, develop one of the concrete ideas into a **cohesive idea**.\n//(It would be good to include the steps of your conceptual development.)//\n\nBy doing this, the comment page should contain **a lot of examples of this technique**.\nIf you are curious about what other people can come up with, take a look!\nIf someone comes up with a cohesive idea you like, ask if you can use it!\n//(They will probably be flattered!)//\n\nEach group of simple ideas has nine corresponding compound ideas.\nEach compound idea can have several concrete ideas.\nEach concrete idea can have **billions** of corresponding cohesive ideas!\n\nI look forward to seeing what you come up with!",
