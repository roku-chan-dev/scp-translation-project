It makes me happy.\"//\n> \n> //\"You think- You think this is fun?! You murdered some-\"//\n> \n> //\"YES! I find it fun, Mom.

Due to this, the containment of SCP-7857-2 and SCP-7857-3 has been deemed impossible; however, due to the lack of signs of threat against humanity, containment may not be necessary. MTF Mu-3 (\"Highest Bidders\") are to visit Barsø Bädelav every week. Designated personnel are not to remain in proximity with SCP-7857 for no longer than twenty-five (25) minutes under any circumstances.\n\nDesignated personnel are given authorization to explore the interior of SCP-7857 for no longer than five (5) minutes. Personnel who have been caught by SCP-7857-1 instances are to be sent to disciplinary action immediately.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7857 is an undefined organization possessing a 50,000 Square-Meter facility adjacent to Barsø Bådelav (55.121269°N 9.558950°E) . All known entrances throughout SCP-7857 are identified to be triple-locked at all times. SCP-7857 employs an undefined number of personnel designated SCP-7857-2 -- formally thought to be 250,000.\n\nSCP-7857-2 instances assume the appearance of a humanoid entity either male or female of unknown descent. SCP-7857-2 instances are deemed non-anomalous. SCP-7857-2 instances deploy SCP-7857-3 instances indiscriminately.\n\nSCP-7857-3 is a colossal zeppelin-like aircraft constructed by SCP-7857-2 instances. SCP-7857-3 is constructed of mostly Titanium and seems to not utilize mechanism or fuel. SCP-7857-2 instances deploy at least three (3) instances of SCP-7857-3 every week. In the event of the designated SCP-7857-3 instance reaching its destination, subject is mandated to continuously release A4 papers. The aforementioned A4 Papers contain extremely concealed information about a specific individual that SCP-7857-2 instances have designated (e.g. subject's //deepest dark secret//, email address, trauma information).\n\n**Addendum 7857-a1:** SCP-7857-2 instances utilize a computer system referred to as \"Intel\". The Intel allows SCP-7857-2 instances to gather all information about individuals worldwide in a short period. The location of the Intel is in the -7F (negative seventh-floor) Research laboratory, which has been discovered following the incident of MTF Mu-03 (\"Highest Bidders\") exploring the underground base of SCP-7857.\n\nThe mechanism inside the Intel is unknown. MTF Mu-03 (\"Highest Bidders\") are being designated to destroy this Intel.\n\n**Addendum 7857-a2:** Individuals from █████ Town, Georgia spotted an instance of SCP-7857-2 falling outside of SCP-7857-3 during its event on June 11, ████. Individuals who have witnessed the aforementioned event have reported this incident to the police and ambulance.\n\nMTF Mu-03 (\"Highest Bidders\") have been deployed and held the SCP-7857-2 instance captive. Agent Juile interviewed the SCP-7857-2 instance to gather information.\n\nThe following dialog below describes the interview.\n\n> = **Interview ID #: 7857aup0**\n> \n> **Interviewer: Agent Juile**\n> \n> **Interviewed: SCP-7857-2 instance**\n> \n> **<BEGIN LOG>**\n> \n> **Agent Juile:** Greetings, S. C. P seven-eight-five-seven dash two. I am Agent Juile. I was sent here to interview you so we could gather more information.\n> \n> **SCP-7857-2 instance:** I would appreciate it if you refrain from calling me S. C. P seven-eight-five-seven dash two as I do not know what that is. From now on and soon, call me \"Kim\".\n> \n> **Agent Juile:** Ah, so you have a name. Alright Kim, why did you work for this organization? If you are kind enough, can you tell me what its established name is? Do your co-workers have names too?\n> \n> **SCP-7857-2 instance:** (no response) I did not work for this organization. I just woke up and I was just there. And yes, everyone in the facility has names.\n> \n> **Agent Juile:** I see. What is this organization's established name?\n> \n> **SCP-7857-2 instance:** I believe that information is confidential.\n> \n> **Agent Juile:** Any specific reasons?\n> \n> **SCP-7857-2 instance:** They just don't like it. They are watching right now. I know it. I recommend you don't ask me things regarding this organization.\n> \n> **Agent Juile:** Right. This may sound a bit... Odd... But... Are you human?\n> \n> **SCP-7857-2 instance:** (distracted, staring at the wall blankly) what?\n> \n> **Agent Juile:** Are you a human being?\n> \n> **SCP-7857-2 instance:** (pause) well... well yes. What else would I be?\n> \n> **Agent Juile:** Good. Last question, and we'll escort you to your room. You will be staying here the rest of your life, Mr. Kim.\n> \n> **SCP-7857-2 instance:** Go on with it, please.\n> \n> **Agent Juile:** Why is this organization revealing everyone's secrets? A secret's a secret, right?\n> \n> **SCP-7857-2 instance:** (angered-like tone) The... The truth will... The truth will always prevail\n> \n> **<END LOG>**\n\nThe interviewed SCP-7857-2 instance seems to identify itself as \"Kim\". SCP-7857-2 instances are proven to be intelligent.\n\n> //\"I don't know what has gotten into him.\"//\n> \n> //\"Because of that... that thing... It caused him harm. No, he caused the harm himself.\"//\n> \n> //\"When is this thing gonna go away? Is- Is anyone even gonna try to stop it? Damn, these people are too lazy to do something.\"//\n> \n> //\"I don't know anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I could feel... Feel his feelings. Why does that thing even exist?\"//\n> \n> //She lit the candles//\n\n**Addendum 7857-a3:** MTF Mu-03 (\"Highest Bidders\") have been deployed to Barsø Bådelav on August 2, ████. Subjects discovered an unsecured hatch behind the facility, which had led to vents. Agent Michael and Agent Sakurai saw a caucasian humanoid entity holding a meeting in an undefined room. The aforementioned entity was deemed as the CEO of SCP-7857.\n\nEfforts have been made to hold the CEO captive; however, the CEO seems to not always be in proximity to SCP-7857. Its reason for absence is unknown.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7856]]] | SCP-7857 | [[[SCP-7858]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
