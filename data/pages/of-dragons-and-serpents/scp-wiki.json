Personnel are to be applied with Memetic Counter-Agent: \"Buzhou\" before proceeding.\n[[/=]]\n\n> The following documents are a collection of poems retrieved from a previously unknown faction of GOI-004 (\"The Church of the Broken God\"). Upon discovery, personnel experienced mild visual hallucinations of various images, depicting dragons similar to those in eastern mythology, or unnaturally sized serpents. No long-term effect has been detected.\n> \n> The poems appear to be translations of materials of different origins, written in various time periods and regions. Notably, unlike other CotBG literature, both the entity \"Mekhane\" (Broken God) and the entity \"Yaldabaoth\" (Sarkic God) are described as dragons or serpents in the texts. They also reveal a more complex relation between the two entities than previously believed. One shows a direct link to ancient Chinese myths; the other is suspected to be linked to [[[SCP-2264|SCP-████]]].\n\n++ His Sword, Like Serpent\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Hypatia, Circa 100 BCE, Lesbos\"

there to enlighten in the Eden, it said,\nThe other a reckless god.\nOne taught us to think and feel, it said,\nThe other bred us from soil.\n\nThe dragons once rest in the abyss, it said,\nThen came their sons and daughters.\nOne had made a cage of His bronze skeleton,\nThe other trapped and suffered.\n\nOne wore a crown of thunder and lightning, it said,\nThe other sat on a throne of bones.\nBut the crown now in pieces and the throne concealed,\nTheir descendants on earth live oblivious.\n\nI shall build Him a temple and an altar, I said,\nSo the dragons shall be remembered.\nI shall light the candles and speak of prayers, I said,\nAnd make sacrifice of blood and steel.\n\nI have taken His sword back from the seashore,\nCrafted an altar out of iron and silver.\nI have laid the pillars and paved the floor,\nLit the candles at nightfall.\n\nI have put His sword up on the altar,\nWhere it coiled like a serpent.\nIt sang in a language not of this world,\nThen spoke about men and war.\n\nIt was when the priests lit the fire of bronze, it said,\nThat the beasts of blood had gathered.\nGreat colossi of metal stood tall with hammers,\nAs horrible angels were called.\n\nIt was when the sky bled a crimson red, it said,\nThat stars all flickered and trembled.\nTeeth and thorns clutching together,\nRoars and clanking long heard.\n\nThere stood the dragons' descendants,\nEach fought for their only god.\nMen implanted themselves with inventions of god;\nMen reborn to be dragons and serpents.\n\nThe one dragon shall cry with His tears of mercury,\nThe other shall laugh as the chains rattle.\nThere stood the dragons' proud descendants,\nRegarding one another as pests and cancer.\n\nThey bit and cut and summoned the lightings,\nUntil one was torn and the other was lost.\nThey fought on earth as their progenitors did in heaven,\nIn elder times and formless void.\n\nThe men are not better than their creators, it said,\nAs the dragons no better than us.\nBut broken is broken and lost is lost, it said,\nAnd I am but a mere sword.\n\nA sword forged by His sacred fires, it said,\nSharpened to impale the heart of another.\nBut as such a weapon I was never used, it said,\nNow lay rusted and shameful.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n++ In His Wasted Kingdom\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Dario Narváez, Circa 1100 CE, Galicia\" hide=\"- Dario Narváez, Circa 1100

out the shattered pieces,\nThe heart, the eyes, and the cage of your skeleton.\n\nSeven pieces you are scattered,\nSeven pieces I will find.\nSeven pieces I will gather,\nSo the dragon shall breathe

may be clear.\nI shall rebuild you, Father Serpent!\nSo Her sins may meet redemption.\n\nI have stood in His wasted kingdom,\nAnd wish I have seen its grander days.\nBut we shall fulfill your wishes,
