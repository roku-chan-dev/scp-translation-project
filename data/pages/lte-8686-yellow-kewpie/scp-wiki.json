Threat entity is a former employee of the SCP Foundation, but an unknown incident resulted in its developing anomalous traits.\n\nThreat entity's primary ability is that any form of currency within a certain area around itself becomes detached from the abstract concept of money. Affected currency ceases to be considered as legal tender on a conceptual basis, despite being fundamentally unchanged. This effect is able to deconceptualize standard cash and change, but also extends to credit or debit cards, which remain considered as legal tender to automated registers and scanners, but cause confusion to humans due to their lack of conceptual value. The effect on digital currency remain unknown, as it lacks a physical location. This effect persists even after the affected currency is no longer within the radius of deconceptualization.\n\nIt is currently estimated that over twelve million dollars have been lost to deconceptualization. The area of the effect around the threat entity appears to be expanding at an exponential rate, albeit at a currently low one, but is expected to encompass the entirety of the planet within the next three years.\n\nThreat entity's secondary ability is that it can witness events up to a few days into its own future. This has caused immense difficulty for Coalition forces, as it is able to witness Coalition capture attempts before they even occur. However, it is apparently only able to witness events around its future location, meaning that private deliberations may still be carried out without its knowledge.\n\n[[size large]]**Liquidation:**[[/size]]\n\nDue to Williams' primary ability, it has been concluded that elimination of the entity would be the desirable goal, as its area of effect is ever-growing and cannot be halted or secured by any known means. However, termination of threat entity is of incredible difficulty, due to its secondary ability, and that its recognizes GOC operatives as a threat. Furthermore, its status as a Type-Yellow entity, rather than a Type-Purple, makes its properties far more difficult to negate remotely[[footnote]]Due to the nature of the incident, as determined by SCP Foundation records, it was initially suspected to be a Type-Purple; this was shortly debunked after analysis by Council-108-47 (SW Foundation).[[/footnote]].\n\nAs a result, the following outline has been prepared, as a rough draft of a termination operation.\n# The GOC forms an agreement with an individual or group which Williams places trust in.\n# Said entity coerces Williams into some form of holding unit or enclosed area, which it would be unable to escape alone.\n# Termination of Williams commences, at least three days after initial containment, via widespread application of deadly force across entirety of enclosed area (e.g. toxic fumes, spread gunfire).\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ PSYCHE Records\n\nThe following represents the message correspondence between the SCP Foundation and Director Maria Kane of the Global Occult Coalition, regarding Penny Williams.\n\n> **Sender:** Dir. Maria Kane, GOC\n> **Recipient:** SCP Foundation\n> \n> To our associates at the SCP Foundation,\n> \n> It has come to the attention of both of our organizations that a former Foundation employee, has been wreaking immense havoc across the United States, only encouraged by efforts to capture it. While its secondary ability would already be a great threat, its primary ability forces widespread damage in a large area, which is continuously expanding.\n> \n> We understand that one of the primary disparities between our organizations is that you would prefer the containment of anomalous objects, even if it comes with great risk, whilst our own organization is far more liberal in this regard. We would like to be clear that the proposal we intend to make would not be made if we didn't judge the gravity of the situation to be this severe.\n> \n> We would like to request your assistance in the elimination of Penny Williams, a former member of your organization. Its effects cannot be contained while it is alive, and it is almost completely impossible to either terminate or even adequately contain, as it perceives the Coalition as an immediate threat. We believe that your organization can establish a sort of trust with it, convincing it that they only seek to contain it, and then lull her into a false sense of security, allowing for a more efficient method of termination. A complete outline of the proposed operation is attached with the given file, and we can discuss the details if you agree to assist us.\n\n> **Sender:** SCP Foundation\n> **Recipient:** Dir. Kane, GOC\n> \n> We are interested in your proposal regarding SCP-3992, or KTE-8686, and the research team for SCP-3992 has expressed a similar interest. However, there are certain policies that must be recognized before your request can be fully considered. The destruction of anomalous objects can only be authorized by our [[[Decom. Dept. Hub|Decommissioning Department]]]. An authorization form has been attached to this message, and will be relayed to the Decom. Dept. upon completion. Certain variables have been pre-filled for your convenience.\n\n> **Sender:** Dir. Kane, GOC\n> **Recipient:** SCP Foundation, Decommissioning Department\n> \n> [[=]]\n> ++ __**SCP Object Decommissioning Proposal Form**__\n> [[/=]]\n> **Item #:** SCP-3992 (KTE-8686)\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Head Researcher:** Jacob Seigert\n> \n> **Supporting Personnel:**\n> * //A.

Its abilities present both an easily recognizable anomalous effect, as well as a threat to the global economy and functionality. The only adequate method of preventing its threat would be its termination, which requires assistance from your SCP Foundation. //- Dir. M. Kane, GOC//\n\n> **Sender:** SCP Foundation, Decommissioning Department\n> **Recipient:** Dir. Kane, GOC\n> \n> Your proposal has been accepted. We look forward to future correspondence and cooperation regarding SCP-3992's decommissioning.\n\nFollowing negotiations, the SCP Foundation and the GOC organized a joint operation aimed at the elimination of KTE-8686.\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ PTOLEMY Records\n\n> ||||||||~ Quartermasters Division-AOD||\n> ||~ Item||~ Designation||~ Title||~ Qty||\n> ||1||ITG-GOC||GOC Termination Gas||4 Canisters||\n> ||||||||**Notes:** Only two canisters were required, with the other two remaining as reserves in case of failure.||\n> ||2||IHCU-SCP||SCP Standard Humanoid Containment Unit||1||\n> ||||||||**Notes:** Utilized to detain KTE-8686 for termination.||\n\n||||||||~ __**Department of Public Relations and Information Concealment**__||\n||~ Sender||Jameson Walter (DPRIC Supervisor)||~ Recipient||Terra Dean||\n||||||~ Subject|| Re: 8686||\n|||||||| Thus far, anything affected by KTE-8686 has been secured by joint task forces from the SCP Foundation and the GOC.

KTE-8686 was restrained, as the interview began exactly three minutes and three days before KTE-8686's scheduled termination, for experimental purposes.\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Hello, SCP-3992. How are you feeling today?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** I'm alright, thank you. Still getting used to the SCP designation, everything's been changing so much.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Understandable. I just have a few questions to ask you.\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** May I ask a quick question first please?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Sure, go ahead.\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** Has there been any progress on a treatment or a cure for me, for my primary... anomaly?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Well, we have an idea for how to deal with your primary anomalous properties. We'll be moving forward with it in a few days.\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** //[Sighs.]// Thank you. If everything works out, will I be free?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** If the operation is successful, then yes, the SCP-3992 slot will be redesignated, and you will no longer be an SCP object.\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** Wonderful. I'm looking forward to it. Sorry about that, what were you gonna ask me?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** To start, do you have any control over your anomalous properties at all?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** Not really, no. The money thing is always on, I think even when I'm sleeping.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** And your precognition?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** I'm always passively seeing stuff for the next few days, but I can block it out mostly.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** And it's a set limit? Nothing past that?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** If I concentrate though, I can sort of get a really vague mood, but nothing substantial.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** I see. Tell me, can you give me an idea of what you're seeing now?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** Nothing much, just myself in a containment unit for the next three days. And beyond that- hmm.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** What's wrong?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** I mean, like I said, I can sort of get a mood at least. It's nothing substantial, but after the next few days... nothing. It's strange.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Let's move on then. I wanted to get your account of how you gained your anomalous properties. We have a report of what happened, we just want your statement on the incident.\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** //[Shrugs.]// I'm not sure what new stuff I can tell you. It's... sorry, I'm still... weird about the future, I still don't feel anything from it.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** It might just be stress, or perhaps the containment. We'll know soon enough, anyway.\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** Right. Well, we were running tests on a pair of new anomalous objects, they didn't even have SCP designations yet - I guess that's where I got my stuff from. By the way, do you know what happened to them?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Destroyed during the incident, unfortunately.\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** Ah, okay. Well, I survived, obviously, and then the next thing I knew I'd woken up in the lab. I knew about the future-seeing stuff almost immediately. But the money thing took me a bit longer, when I was trying to access a vending machine. By that point, I figured it was a matter of time before everyone else found out, so I panicked and ran away.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** I see. Something we did notice was that you had a tendency to avoid populated areas while you were away, was this deliberate?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** I mean, yeah. I didn't want my abilities to end up causing damage, especially for people who actually needed- need-\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Are you alright?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** I don't- I'm feeling- I don't understand.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Can you describe to me what you're feeling please?\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** I don't //know// what this is, I've never felt it before, I don't-\n> \n> **Interviewer:** You're going to be fine. //[At this moment, the time changes to 10:00, exactly three days before the termination of KTE-8686 is scheduled.]// Now, could you-\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** //[Begins screaming.]// Wait, what? Why are you doing this, I-\n> \n> **Interviewer:** SCP-3992, could you please-\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** You said you wouldn't hurt me! That I'd be safe here! //[Begins crying.]//\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Again, SCP-\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** Don't call me that! Don't! I want to be safe! You're going to kill me! Please-\n> \n> **Interviewer:** I believe we have the results we need, this interview is over.\n> \n> **KTE-8686:** //[Attempts to break free of restraints.]// You said you'd help! I don't want to die!\n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n||~ Joint SCP/GOC Task Force Report ||\n\n**Involved Assessment/Strike Team:** AT-229\n\n**Filing Operative:** \"Nickel\" 94762947/639\n\n**Mission:** Termination of KTE-8686.\n\n**Encounter Report/Enemy Description:** Enemy was secured in SCPF Area-137, four days before termination.
