My body is mine and mine only.\"}}\n\nAll personnel failing to do so are to leave the entry point under the threat of immediate termination.\n[[/div]]\n\nThe area in which SCP-5936 manifests has been acquired by the Foundation with a one-kilometer exclusion zone established around it. A disinformation campaign attributing the quarantine to a radiation leak has been devised and is to be disseminated to media and news outlets in nearby communities. All individuals extremal to the Foundation that attempt to enter the area must be denied access and directed to one of the surrounding towns.\n\nFollowing Event 5936-1, all action-planning regarding SCP-5936 has been moved to Site-120. \n-----\n++++ **__Description__**\n\n[[include component:image-block name=czstclean1|align=right|caption=The approximate location of SCP-5936’s manifestation.|width=250px]]\n\nSCP-5936 is a spatial disruption occurring approximately 2 kilometers north of the town of Częstochowa, Poland; the anomaly's interior is approximately 100 km² -- 78% larger than the area of 56 km² expected. Additionally, SCP-5936 can only be observed and entered by individuals that:\n* Are non-religious,\n* [[[critter-profile-sparky|Have lost a close relative or friend]]],\n* Have worked with or been a witness of occult phenomena.\n\nWhenever an individual is brought near the anomaly that does not meet the above criteria, they neglect its existence, claiming to only see a barren field[[footnote]] One similar to those surrounding the area SCP-5936 manifests in. [[/footnote]] and expressing a desire to leave the area.\n\nAlthough scans and surveys of SCP-5936 have found no lifeforms inhabiting the area naturally, subjects who enter the anomaly have reported:\n\n* Sensations of being watched, \n* Paranoia of the presence of someone nearby,\n* Feelings of immense, irrational hatred and sorrow.\n\nThe inside of SCP-5936 consists primarily of an urban topological district incorporating elements such as parking lots, playgrounds, shops, and a singular park. The weather within SCP-5936 will contain dense fog and clouds, despite the weather surrounding the anomaly. Additionally, once an individual has crossed the threshold into SCP-5936, they will find that the sun sits at a consistent 6° altitude; indicative of ~ 17:00 (5:00 PM) in the area.\n\nSCP-5936-1 is a designation given to a currently unknown number of violent entities manifesting within the borders of SCP-5936. The anomalous humanoids bear the resemblance to distorted //homo sapiens// and are heavily disconnected from local reality. For further information regarding SCP-5936-1 instances, see Addendum 5936-3.\n\n-----\n++++ **__Discovery__**\n\n\n[[include component:image-block name=fog|align=right|caption=The park present within SCP-5936.|width=250px]]\n\n\nSCP-5936 was discovered on 21/02/1984 during Site-120's routine check of surrounding towns for potential anomalous phenomena. After five patients in local clinics were reported to have experienced hallucinations of a nonexistent district of the town, the Foundation was notified and an investigation regarding said reports was initiated. Multiple interviews with individuals supposedly affected by said hallucinations were made, and as a result, SCP-5936 was discovered shortly after.\n\n----\n++++ **__Addendum 5936-1 -- Exploration Logs__**\n\nThe first exploration log of SCP-5936 was recorded shortly after the anomaly was detected. Due to the personnel requirements being discovered not long following initial contact, a special Mobile Task Force, Omega-5 (\"The Good Boys\") meeting them was created for the purpose of SCP-5936 research. In order to gather all information regarding SCP-5936, provisional Outpost-120-1 was created near the entrance of the anomaly.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Exploration Log 5936-1\" hide=\"▼ Exploration Log 5936-1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 16/03/1984\n\n**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Omega-5\n\n**Subject:** SCP-5936\n\n**Team Lead:** Om-5-1\n\n**Team Members:** Om-5-2, Om-5-3, Om-5-4, Om-5-5\n\n**Foreword:** The exact properties of SCP-5936 were, as of then, unknown.\n\n-----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**Om-5-1:** Recording's on.

They stop near the door to one of the apartments.//\n\n**Om-5-3:** Oi, doc, you seeing this? There's some sort of a, a... uhh... magic-ish symbol here. \n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Give me a moment... yeah, I see it.\n\n**Om-5-1:** What does it mean?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Well, that's not how thaumaturgic symbols work... I'm not familiar with this one, hold on a second. Give me like three minutes, okay?\n\n//Two minutes pass.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** ...you absolutely sure? Alright. Well, let's begin with the fact that this should not be here. It's beyond old. I've only seen it used twice, at best. It's an amalgamation of two signs that, when combined, literally mean \"to open a gateway with a sacrifice\". Without the context of the full spell, I can't tell you what that truly means.

A TV can be heard in the background.//\n\n**Om-5-3:** Doc, you //absolutely sure// there is no one in the building?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** What? Yes, why?\n\n**Om-5-3:** There is an unfinished meal, still hot, just... just sitting there on the table.\n\n**Om-5-1:** And the oven is still on. \n\n**Om-5-4:** So is the TV. It's... it's stuck it seems though. On one frame. It has a calendar for the year of 1952 above it, with uh, 27th of march being the final marked day.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** As I said, the previous scans have shown nothing. But if you insist, I'll do a full-spectrum one of the area including all of the anomalous sensors, but that will take a moment.\n\n**Om-5-1:** Understood.\n\n//Five minutes pass. Nothing in the environment of the apartment changes, with the TV still showing the same frame and the meals not changing their temprerature.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Nothing. Again. There is literally not a single lifeform here. Not even bugs.\n\n**Om-5-1:** There's some weird shit going on here, doc.

Though--\n\n**Om-5A-4:** Here's something.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Yes?\n\n**Om-5A-4:** Well, it's some wet journal pages from what I can see... most of it is some non-sensical gibberish... you seeing this, doc?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Yup. Well, those //are// thaumaturgic-ish runes, or at least runes stylized after the thaumaturgic ones, but it's too soaked for me to actually study it. At least from here.

Though three out of five entrances to the other rooms are bricked off.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Go into the closer one then, and let's see what's there.\n\n**Om-5A-4:** Roger.\n\n//Omega-5A come near the entrance to one of the non-blocked rooms.//\n\n**Om-5A-1:** Another rune. A bit different from the last one from what it looks like.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Give me a second then, let me get my notes on those ones...  Got it. Alright, this one's supposed to be 'protection', as simple as that is. It's still written in a very old language, though. What about the inside of the room?\n\n**Om-5A-1:** It seems that there's nothing more here than some sort of a cork board connecting different photos of the town. And a bunch of chairs around it.\n\n**Om-5A-2:** Some more notes here. Looks pretty similar to the ones from before, though.\n\n**Om-5A-3:** Other than that, it's just your regular basement stuff from what it seems. You know, potato sacks and stuff like that.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Alright, that only leaves the second room, then.\n\n**Om-5A-4:** Looks like today's your lucky day, doc. Another rune. Looks like the one from before, though. And another cross around it. This time, with a, uh, a message, I guess? \"The hand of the Lord shall protect you\".\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Hmmm... it's not the same. It looks almost identical, but the bottom part of the right side is missing, see? It's another one of those weird amalgamations of signs. Hmm...\n\n**Om-5A-1:** //Coughs// Oh my Jesus fucking Christ. //Coughs//\n\n**Om-5A-2:** Eugh... \n\n**Om-5A-1:** It looks like we found the lifeforms you detected.

The following are their reported results.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Additonal Files — SCP-5936 — 1\" hide=\"▼ Additonal Files — SCP-5936 — 1\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: #ECEAD1;\" \"float: center; border: solid 1px #444444; width: auto; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); font-family: 'Bahnschrift SemiBold';\"]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n++ {{Background interrogation for the location of SCP-5936}}\n[[/=]]\n\nIn order to ascertain the nature and location of SCP-5936 prior to the presumed ritual being carried out near it, a background check has been requested by its research team.\n\nInitially, no recordings of any inhabitants or even the existence of any sub-town area located within the area occupied by SCP-5936 existing in the past were found upon coming into contact with local archival offices and authorities. A detailed search revealed that no place had ever existed -- plans of creating a sub-area almost identical to the landscape of SCP-5936 were in fact created in 1945 following the end of World War II, but were canceled due to a lack of budget reported within the yearly spending plan of the new communistic rule established upon Poland following the end of said event. \n\nHowever, when the local population census and the documents surrounding such for the years of 1952 -- 1984 was in-dethply studied by Site-120's RAISA employees, exactly one mention of a wanted individual know as Damien Nowak, originating from a nonexisting district of Częstochowa referred to as \"Tysiąclecie Dolne\", which would, as referred by in documents,  be located in the exact location SCP-5936 manifests in.\n\nFurther background search on Nowak undertaken by Dr. Rivera, a member of the research team of SCP-5936 trained in memetic resistance, revealed that a district identical to the inside of SCP-5936 did indeed exist; backchecking on previously analyzed documents by Dr. Rivera yielded surprising results -- every single one of them did discuss the existence of such a district; the information was, however, locked behind an antimeme.\n\nThe recovered data holds that Tysiąclecie Dolne was an actual, existing place, holding the population for approximately 1200 residents, distributed as follows:\n\n* 200 men\n* 400 women\n* 600 children\n\nDue to the recentness of the building project when in the context of the recent ending of World War II ending prior to the even taking place, most of the population of Tysiąclecie Dolne consisted of women and children. The population and the buildings were in great disrepair due to the military actions undertaken by opposing forces during the conflict. It is of note that the population had requested more capital for the purpose of building renovation from local authorities on multiple occasions -- all of such were denied.\n\nThe current hypothesis constructed by the currently available material regarding SCP-5936, such as the ritual translation provided by Dr. Asheworth and external papers discussing the place, holds that the line in the poetic ritual instructions describing \"deleting a region\" should be interpreted literally; in result, the thaumaturgic action not only presumably killed the people located within the region, but literally deleted it and alongside all of the mentions of it from history.\n\nFurther research is ongoing.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Additonal Files — SCP-5936 — 2\" hide=\"▼ Additonal Files — SCP-5936 — 2\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: #ECEAD1;\" \"float: center; border: solid 1px #444444; width: auto; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); font-family: 'Bahnschrift SemiBold';\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ {{Additional material recovered from SCP-5936}}\n[[/=]]\n\nUpon taking the previously mentioned hypothesis into consideration, Dr. Asheworth personally requested more contextual material be attempted to recover from SCP-5936 in hopes of confirming or denying such.
