Do not look away from the screen. Ignore any and all unusual sounds around you. The containment procedures are being put in place as you continue reading this document. Do not stop reading this document. Follow all instructions carefully and make sure that all content is understood. Due to potentially hazardous effects of long-term exposure, avoid rereading parts of this document. An image file in PNG format is attached to this message. View the image regularly, as you keep reading. If the image changes to a degree that the original content is no longer recognizable, referred to as the distortion point, immediately forward this message to another Foundation employee displaying ability to operate under stress and loyalty to the Foundation's cause. Do not stop reading this document.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999;width:95%;background:grey;float:center;margin-left:4px\"]]\n[[span style=\"padding-left:5px\"]] **Open attachment** [[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image Iteration_1 width=\"400px\" height=\"300px\"]]\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-3626[[footnote]] ##blue| Hello## [[/footnote]] is the message you are currently reading. Persons who open SCP-3626 will be transported to a pocket dimension, or otherwise separated from the outside world. All living beings within line of sight will disappear. The details of this are unclear, as when affected subjects attempt to view objects different from the device currently displaying SCP-3626 on, they will suffer hallucinations. The nature of hallucinations differs, but they are sometimes connected with traumatic events from subject's past and often follow //Moloch//-class --fright-- ##blue|love##  inducing anomalous vision patterns. Affected subjects are advised to avoid looking away from the screen. The intensity of the visions increases along with time spent under effects of SCP-3626, eventually affecting the device holding SCP-3626 itself. This influence is visible in the attached JPG file. Do not stop reading this document.\n\nThe hallucinogenic properties of SCP-3626 make it difficult for subjects to leave their immediate area ##blue|because they see things that they shouldn't see##. Subjects who have managed to do so, have found all the doors or windows barred and were unable to leave the room they were in when they first accessed SCP-3626, ##blue|trapped alone with their thoughts, paranoid that something is out to get them. There is nothing here. Only your thoughts. Only you. Let them take over##. This is hypothesized to be a conscious action by a third-party capable of bending reality attempting to keep SCP-3626 contained [[footnote]] See the original message attached to this document for details [[/footnote]]. The purpose of this containment is unknown, but it is theorized that the anomaly could --have large destructive potential-- ##blue|be completely harmless##   and the current method is the only way of keeping its effects under control. Do not stop reading this document.\n\nIt is unknown what happens when the hallucinatory effects are allowed to progress beyond the distortion point. Due to the fact that no documentation of it is provided in SCP-3626, it is assumed that the affected subject is unable to cancel the effects of the anomaly beyond this point. Probable explanations include inability to operate the device due to the increased severity of the hallucinations, permanent confinement in the pocket dimension, or expiration of the subject. Do not stop reading this document. ##blue|Stop reading this document.##\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999;width:95%;background:grey;float:center;margin-left:4px\"]]\n[[span style=\"padding-left:5px\"]] **Open attachment** [[/span]]\n[[/div]] \n[[=image Iteration_2 width=\"400px\" height=\"300px\"]]\n\n\nIf SCP-3626 is forwarded to another individual via standard electronic email message, the effects will cease##blue|, we hope so, they have to stop, please make it stop, make it stop!## This is implied by the fact that no edits were made by individuals claiming to have forwarded the message. As SCP-3626 is not an anomaly currently contained by the Foundation and likely was not even discovered, it is theorized that individuals who forward SCP-3626 undergo an effect similar to amnestic treatment, making the anomaly undetectable. It is possible that one or more individuals have decided not to forward SCP-3626, but due to similar effects the knowledge of that is supressed. This may mean that neutralization of the anomaly is not possible. Do not stop reading this document.\n\nThe first instance of SCP-3626 was received on 29th of January 2018, by Dr. Burke, Site-42 staff and the original creator of this --SCP file-- ##blue|madness##. The original message is attached below and is the source of most theories about the origin and workings of SCP-3626. ##blue|They lie.## Do not stop reading this document.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999;width:95%;background:grey;float:center;margin-left:4px\"]]\n[[span style=\"padding-left:5px\"]] **Open attachment** [[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> To the unfortunate one\n> \n> I am sorry, it wasn't meant to go this way. We wanted to secure it, lock it in a cage. We did in a manner, but some cages aren't like the others. You wouldn't understand the details anyway, so I won't waste your precious time with technical details. You are in this cage and you are not alone there. The thing that's locked with you wants to get out. You have to make a choice. Either you stay and let it take you, or you pass the cage further.\n> \n> Make your choice\n> \n> Caretaker\n\nDue to the contents of this message it is theorized that SCP-3626 is a method of containment for the aforementioned entity inhabiting the pocket dimension you are currently residing in, or a type of test, ##blue|so relax and take it##. It is currently unknown what happens after to the subject once the distortion point has been passed [[footnote]] ##blue| I walked down the road and the road twisted and turned and I stood where I started, the road never ends, for it needs to feed, the road needs to feed, it needs to feed, it feeds when it has to, but it cannot feed, it is locked, it cannot move, the road has to move, it has to feed, it has to feed, it has to feed, now someone is here, it needs to feed, I can't walk down the road anymore, I need to send, send it, send , send, because otherwise the road will feed on me ## [[/footnote]].

Every day we agree to things that do not sit well with us. We pass by the homeless, telling ourselves that there are places and people that help them. We accept the tyrannical boss, because we won't risk our career to step up and say that it's wrong to be a piece of shit. We live in cycles, spinning like a dog chasing its tail, because we do not have the courage to stop and ask ourselves why we are doing what we're doing. You will probably just send this message to someone and that someone will send it to someone and so on and so on. We will continue chasing the fucking tail, because it takes courage to not do it. Maybe one day the whole Foundation will be on the list here, not one of them realizing that they condemned their friends to take a test. It's good that we don't remember anything after this hell is over. I wouldn't be able to live after discovering my cowardice.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999;width:95%;background:grey;float:center;margin-left:4px\"]]\n[[span style=\"padding-left:5px\"]] **Open attachment** [[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image Iteration_4 width=\"400px\" height=\"300px\"]]\n\nYou have arrived at the end of this document.

The website address allowing for transportation to SCP-3626-1 is to be monitored for access by individuals other than verified Foundation personnel.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3626 is a personal computer, composed of non-anomalous materials[[footnote]] For further details see document 3626-D3 [[/footnote]] , running a copy of Windows Vista OS. No applications beyond Internet Explorer are installed on the device. It bears branding of a non-existent company //Inter-planar Delivery Services//. A note engraved on the side of the object reads \"Property of the Ministry of Extra-planar Sociological Research\". Anomalous properties of the object manifest when one accesses a website http://ewww.██████/results/████████████.gov. Any individuals viewing the screen at the moment when the website is accessed, will be transported to SCP-3626-1. Individuals viewing the screen after the website has been opened will not be affected. Closing the website on SCP-3626 will immediately return all individuals within SCP-3626-1 back to the material world. GPS and other tracking methods cannot locate individuals in SCP-3626-1, but radio communication functions normally.\n\nSCP-3626-1 is a featureless flat landscape, located outside of the known space. The surface of SCP-3626-1 is composed of a grey impenetrable material. The only noteworthy feature of SCP-3626-1 is a wall composed of the same material. Atmosphere within SCP-3626-1 is similar to Earth's.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-3626 was recovered from Site-43 personnel quarters after Senior Researcher ███ █████ discovered that their personal computer was replaced with a different device and a note with the website address required for anomalous properties to manifest. ███ █████ claims that they were answering private messages, when the anomaly suddenly appeared. Further research pending.\n\n**Addendum 3626-A:** Text inscribed on the wall found within SCP-3626-1.\n\n> Congratulations! Your universe has completed the survey successfully.
