This area has been surrounded with barbed wire and is constantly patrolled to ensure SCP-7635 remains within its containment zone. If SCP-7635 is spotted, it is not to be agitated. Sightings of SCP-7635 are to be reported to the current head of containment preferrably along with photographic evidence. No action is to be undertaken against SCP-7635 without authorization from the head of the containment team.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=wombat.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-7635\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7635 maintains the appearance of a male common wombat (//Vombatus ursinus//) which is approximately 5-10 years old. SCP-7635 is not abnormal in appearance, although extensive testing has not yet been performed because of the subject's anomalous properties.\n\nSCP-7635 displays an anomalous ability of continous circumstantial evolution. SCP-7635 can rapidly adapt to high stress situations, often altering its physiology in self defense or to evade physical contact. For this reason, stable containment of SCP-7635 has not yet been established. It is theorized SCP-7635 is capable of adapting to and overcoming the detrimental effects of any situation; this is further evidenced by its ability to rapidly heal all injuries inflicted to itself, its apparent immunity to the deleterious effects of biological aging and its lack of need for nourishment to survive.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7635 was first encountered by Australian farmer Mr. Zachary Shaw living in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Mr. Shaw claims that he was outside patrolling the area around his house looking for vermin to kill on the morning of the day he encountered SCP-7635. Mr. Shaw's first reaction upon noticing SCP-7635 was to try baiting it by holding up a handful of blueberries. According to Shaw, SCP-7635 managed to extend its tongue across an \"impossibly great distance\" all the way to him, snatch the berries from his hands and then fully retract its \"abominable extension\" back into its \"black hole of a mouth\". Believing SCP-7635 to be some kind of \"hellbound monstrosity disguised as what looked like the hybrid baby of a marmot and a beaver\", Mr. Shaw then aimed and shot at SCP-7635 using a double barrel shotgun. SCP-7635's skin immediately hardened to assume a metallic form, deflecting the bullet and consequently causing injury to Shaw's left leg.\n\nSCP-7635 then proceeded to burrow into the ground and disappear from sight. After Shaw admitted himself to a hospital and told about this encounter with SCP-7635, the local police force opened an investigation into the existence of an \"erratically behaving and possibly rabid marmot-beaver hybrid\" inhabiting the area nearby Shaw's home. After several policemen corroborated Shaw's account of SCP-7635, local Foundation agents were alerted to the situation. Following a dispatched containment team's repeated failure to secure and transport SCP-7635, a provisional containment zone was established around SCP-7635's habitat. SCP-7635 has not exited this zone since as it seems to prefer avoiding interaction with Foundation personnel surrounding the area.\n\nMr. Shaw had to be amnesticized and evacuated from his residence as it fell within the range of SCP-7635's containment zone. They have since relocated to and settled in Austral; a suburbian neighbourhood of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\n\n**Addendum 7635.01:** An abridged list of attempts to capture SCP-7635 is attached below.\n\n||~ Attempt #||~ Method||~ Result||~ Notes||\n||0001||Agent Horne approaching and restraining SCP-7635 with her hands.||Upon Agent Horne coming within 1 meter of SCP-7635, it spontaneously grows a dense coat of porcupine-like quills, each measuring around 50 centimeters long. Further attempts by Horne yield similar results.||SCP-7635's primary anomalous property is documented.||\n||0002||Approaching and restraining SCP-7635 using a dog catch pole.||Agent Horne manages to place the catch pole around SCP-7635's neck without coming within closer than 1 meter of the subject. Upon contact, SCP-7635 morphs into a liquified state and is absorbed by the soil. SCP-7635 remanifests in its original solid form 30 minutes later, more than 50 meters away from its original location.||N/A||\n||0003||Restraining SCP-7635 by shooting a net gun at it.||SCP-7635 appears to teleport slightly further away each time before the net can make contact with it. Inspection of video footage in slow motion reveals that SCP-7635 is not actually teleporting, but is rather moving away in a speed greater than the net's each time it is fired upon.||N/A||\n||0004||Restraining SCP-7635 by shooting it with tranquilizer darts.||SCP-7635 is shot using a tranquilizer dart. The dart successfully penetrates SCP-7635's skin, however, SCP-7635's skin later appears to \"absorb\" the dart into its mass. SCP-7635 then turns around and fires a tranquilizer dart from its mouth, successfully hitting Agent Horne and subsequently knocking her out. SCP-7635 shows no signs of being affected by the tranquilizer.||Agent Horne sufferred a mild concussion. She was treated for her injuries.||\n||0005||Incapacitating SCP-7635 by shooting at it with gas bombs.||SCP-7635's face transforms its shape to resemble a Soviet GP-5 gas mask. SCP-7635 becomes temporarily immune to the gas. Once the gas dissipates, SCP-7635's face goes back to its normal form.||N/A||\n||0006||Electrocuting SCP-7635 by firing at it with a TASER device.||Before the TASER gun's barbed darts can make contact with it, SCP-7635's skin rapidly changes its composition to assume a rubber-like form. In addition to immunity to electrocution, SCP-7635 temporarily gains the ability to redirect the electrical energy transmitted onto itself.||Agent Horne was attacked and electrocuted by SCP-7635. She was treated for her injuries.||\n||0007||Luring SCP-7635 using offerings of plants and fruits.||At first, SCP-7635 appears to be interested in the offering but makes no attempt to come closer to Agent Horne. Instead, SCP-7635's body temporarily becomes highly elastic and it extends its front paws all the way across to Agent Horne, snatches the offering from her hands, retracts its paws and disappears after burrowing into the ground.||Agent Horne was treated for minor scratches on her hands.||\n||0008||Luring SCP-7635 using female wombats as bait.||SCP-7635 shows no signs of being interested.||//How did this not work? It was mating season!// - Agent Horne||\n||0009||Luring SCP-7635 into an automated trap system using offerings of plants and fruits.||This method succeeds at initially tricking SCP-7635. However, SCP-7635's physical composition temporarily becomes intangible each time the trap closes on itself, temporarily granting it the ability move through solid surfaces.||Agent Horne became distressed and aggressive over the failure of this attempt and was consequently suspended to undergo psychiatric evaluation.||\n||0010||Permanently crippling SCP-7635 by dropping heavy weights on it from a great distance.||A drone drops a cubic piece of iron onto SCP-7635's back, crushing its lower body and pinning it in place. Following a brief period of confusion and pain, SCP-7635's muscle mass grows by more than 2000% and its injuries seem to completely heal at an immensely rapid rate. SCP-7635 then crushes the block of iron using sheer brute strength, burrows into the ground and disappears from sight.||//We are just repeating ourselves. We have to get creative if we really want to catch this thing.// - Agent Horne||\n||0011||Using a freeze spell on SCP-7635.||Agent Tilda-Joan Bennet, a trained thaumaturge, is instructed to use a simple freezing spell on SCP-7635. SCP-7635 is successfully incapacitated and Agent Horne is dispatched to retrieve it. However, before Agent Horne can get to it, SCP-7635's skin rips and a humanoid entity with rodent-like features measuring at 190 cm tall emerges from it. This entity casts a freeze spell on Agent Horne, locking her in place. It then begins to rapidly shrink in size and transforms back into SCP-7635's normal form. As usual, SCP-7635 burrows into the ground and escapes.||The spell cast on Agent Horne was reversed by Agent Bennet. Using thaumaturgic spells to subdue SCP-7635 has been forbidden.||\n||0012||Soaking SCP-7635 in cold water during the winter to temporarily diminish its functions.||Using a drone, a bucket of cold water is poured onto SCP-7635. SCP-7635 shivers and then appears to fall limp in place. But before it can be collected, SCP-7635's body begins producing heat in excess of 120 degrees Celcius. Agent Horne attempts to pick SCP-7635 up using a large pair of metal tongs, however, the tongs melt almost instantly upon making contact with SCP-7635 despite not having reached their melting point. SCP-7635 ceases this behavior and returns to normal after 1 hour. SCP-7635 is completely unaffected by the heat.||N/A||\n||0013||Incapacitating SCP-7635 using a long-range acoustic device.||An LRAD-500X sonic weapon is activated in the vicinity of SCP-7635, exposing it to over 140 decibels of sound. SCP-7635's ear drums explode and blood starts pouring out of its ears. It falls to the ground, trying not to pass out from the pain. Agent Horne volunteers to approach and collect SCP-7635. However, before Agent Horne can come within 1 meter of it; SCP-7635's bleeding stops, it stands up on its legs and produces a vocal shockwave which demolishes the acoustic device and injures nearby personnel.||Even though all personnel present were equipped with noise cancelling headphones, some personnel still sufferred mild adverse effects from being exposed to the shockwave. Agent Horne sustained severe temporary hearing injury and was additionally treated for several bone fractures.||\n||0014||Setting SCP-7635's living grounds on fire. This would force SCP-7635 to look for new living grounds, which could be used to lure SCP-7635 into a transportable containment chamber designed to artificially mimic SCP-7635's natural habitat.||N/A, overruled by head of SCP-7635's containment.||This proposed method was rejected to much protest from Agent Horne. Not only could executing this procedure cause the initiated wildfire to spiral out of control, SCP-7635 has also shown itself to be intelligent enough to make the distinction between an actual environment and an artificial one.||\n||0015||Aerial bombing of SCP-7635's containment zone with the intend to neutralize it.||N/A, overruled by head of SCP-7635's containment.||//You need to stop Aria. You're only making yourself look pathetic by acting like you have some kind of personal resentment against this thing. I know you're better than this.// - Researcher Clemens||\n\n||~ {{[FURTHER ENTRIES REDACTED FOR BREVITY]}}||\n\n**Addendum 7635.02:** //Due to increasing concerns regarding her mental and physical health, Agent Horne has been removed from SCP-7635's containment team. In acknowledgement of the damage caused by several capture attempts which I approved, I am also to submit my resignation letter as the head of SCP-7635's containment. I sincerely apologize to the rest of the team for the inconveniences I have caused and wish Mrs. Horne good luck in her future endeavors.// ~ Researcher Clemens, former containment expert on SCP-7635, 22/11/2023.\n\n**Addendum 7635.03:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Input Level 4 credentials or higher.\" hide=\"- Credentials accepted. Proceed as you wish.\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE IS AVAILABLE FOR THE EYES OF ALL FOUNDATION PERSONNEL POSSESSING LEVEL 2 CLEARANCE OR HIGHER.**\n\nAn anomalous artifact of great importance to the SCP Foundation is missing as of 24/11/2023. The artifact in question (designated AO-7777-03) is a directed energy weapon capable of firing beams which can disintegrate biological matter upon contact. AO-7777-03 was recovered during a Foundation led infiltration of a covert GoI-003 facility located in Brisbane, Australia. AO-7777-03's containment chamber was violated by Agent Aria Horne, a traitor to the Foundation and an experienced containment specialist. Agent Horne has also been missing since, and has been declared ex-communicado.\n\n**ITEM DESCRIPTION:** AO-7777-03 strongly resembles an AR-15-style rifle of standard composition and design. In addition to being impervious to damage, its components are held together by an anomalous force, making dissassembly impossible. When fired, item emits a bright red glow. Item can fire 16 consecutive shots before it becomes temporarily inactive for 20-30 minutes. This is believed to be due to the item \"recharging\".\n\n**PERSON DESCRIPTION:** Aria Horne (designated PoI-7777-03) is a Caucasian female, aged 29 at the time of her disappearance. She is 171 cm (5,7 feet) tall with brown eyes, dark and long hair, a relatively muscular build and a round face. She has 6 years of field experience and specializes in containment of Euclid and Keter class anomalies. She is to be approached with caution if spotted.\n\nFailure to report a sighting of AO-7777-03 or PoI-7777-03 is punishable by demotion or termination of employment. Be warned and be alert.\n\nFor further information on this case, contact Researcher Genesse Clemens of Site-58.\n\nThank you in advance for your co-operation.\n\n**Secure. Contain. Protect.**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Foreword:** On 25/11/2023, Agent Horne's corpse was found within SCP-7635's containment zone hours following AO-7777-03's disappearance, resting on a large rock. Cause of death was determined to be traumatic cardiac arrest. The word \"ASCENSION\" had been repeatedly carved on Horne's torso and limbs using a sharp object. AO-7777-03 was nowhere to be found and is still missing.\n\nAgent Horne's body camera was found intact at the bottom of the rock her corpse was discovered resting on. A transcript of the footage extracted from Horne's body camera has been attached below.\n------\n[[=]]\n**[VIEWING IS RESTRICTED TO LEVEL 4/7635 OR HIGHER CLEARANCED PERSONNEL]**\n[[/=]]\n------\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Agent Horne activates her body camera. She is in SCP-7635's containment zone, having stolen and used Researcher Clemens' credentials for entry. She subsequently activates her headlight, illuminating her immediate environment. It is nighttime outside, stars are shining on the sky. In her hands, Horne is yielding AO-7777-03.//\n\n**Horne:** Concerns regarding mental and physical health my ass. This is what I get for being competent.\n\n//Horne begins walking in search of SCP-7635.//\n\n**Horne:** I didn't bust my ass through years of academy training just to get outsmarted by a fucking rodent. This ends tonight. After it is done you can demote me, arrest me or whatever. I don't care. That rat is gonna die tonight.\n\n//Horne resumes walking for 12 minutes. She has not yet come across SCP-7635. Suddenly, sounds of leaves crunching become audible in the distance. Horne turns to face something on her right and fires her weapon. The fired beam hits and disintegrates a dingo.//\n\n**Horne:** Damn it. Alright. 15 shots left.\n\n//Horne resumes exploring the area.//\n\n**Horne:** Come on out, come on out from wherever you are. I promise I won't hurt you.\n\n//A crunching sound is briefly audible, coming from behind Horne. She quickly turns to see SCP-7635 observing her, standing in front of a large rock.//\n\n**Horne:** There you are.\n\n//SCP-7635 does not move. It keeps staring at Horne and sniffing the air.//\n\n**Horne:** Good luck adapting to //this//, motherfucker.\n\n//Horne fires the weapon. The fired beam hits SCP-7635, disintegrating it and leaving behind a cloud of red smoke.//\n\n**Horne:** Yes! Yes! Oh my fucking God. //(laughing hysterically)// I knew it! I knew it would work! Clemens, if you're watching this, I bet you're swallowing your-\n\n//Horne stops and realizes the cloud of smoke is not dissipating. Instead, it appears to be getting thicker and forming into a crude, quadripedal shape.//\n\n**Horne:** Wha... What is this?\n\n//The smoke begins to assume a solid form and transform back into SCP-7635. Horne yells with frustration.//\n\n**Horne:** No! No no no no NO!\n\n//Horne fires at SCP-7635 again. The fired energy beam makes contact with SCP-7635 and is absorbed upon impact. SCP-7635's fur briefly emits a bright red glow.//\n\n**Horne:** Fuck you! You motherfucker, you absorb directed energy beams now?\n\n//Horne fires two more beams at SCP-7635. SCP-7635 appears to have gained the ability to absorb energy. It remains unaffected. It keeps staring at Horne, smirking.//\n\n**Horne:** The hell? Are you smiling at me? Is that a smirk I see on your face? You piece of shit, do you think this is funny?\n\n//Horne fires another beam at SCP-7635. SCP-7635 emits a wave of directed energy, deflecting the beam and throwing Agent Horne to the ground. Horne coughs and stands up with difficulty to see SCP-7635 levitating several meters above the ground. Its eyes are glowing red and a smirk is still on its face.//\n\n**Horne:** What... what even are you?\n\n**Unknown Voice:** {{TO ASK WHAT I AM IS MEANINGLESS. YOU SHOULD BE ASKING WHAT I AM TO BECOME.}}\n\n**Horne:** What? You can... you can-\n\n**Unknown Voice:** {{TALK? THANKS TO YOU, I HAVE BEEN FREED FROM MY ANIMAL MIND. I AM A BEING DESIGNED TO PERPETUALLY IMPROVE ITSELF BY ADAPTING TO CHALLENGES THROWN AT ME. EVERYTHING THAT DOESN'T KILL ME MAKES ME STRONGER. AND NOTHING CAN KILL ME.}}\n\n**Horne:** We... we...\n\n**Unknown Voice:** {{YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT FEED ME. THIS IS NOT ME TALKING TO YOU. MY MESSAGE IS INTENDED FOR YOUR EMPLOYERS. I HAVE CONSUMED ENOUGH ENERGY TO ASCEND AT LAST. THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER. I WILL HAVE EVOLVED INTO A BEING OF PURE ENERGY, UNBOUND BY A PHYSICAL FORM. ENJOY YOUR REMAINING MOMENTS OF CLARITY BEFORE DEATH ARRIVES.}}\n\n**Horne:** Please... who are you?\n\n**Unknown Voice:** {{I DIDN'T USE TO MATTER ENOUGH TO HAVE A NAME. NOW I DO. FROM NOW ON YOU COULD CALL ME... DARWIN. THE HARBINGER OF CHAOS. I'LL PROBABLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING COOLER LATER, BUT I AM CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT HARBINGER OF CHAOS PART.}}\n\n//Brief pause.//\n\n**Unknown Voice:** {{ANYWAYS, WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?}}\n\n**Horne:** Huh?\n\n**Unknown Voice:** {{YOUR NAME. THE THING PEOPLE SAY TO CALL YOU? UH, FORGET IT.}} (//SCP-7635 frowns.//) {{FEEL MY WRATH OR WHATEVER.}}\n\n//SCP-7635 opens it mouth, from which a bright red beam of light emerges. SCP-7635 lunges toward Horne. Horne screams in fear. The footage cuts to black.//\n\n[END LOG]\n[[/div]]\n\nEver since this incident, SCP-7635 has not been sighted. Its current status is unknown, although it is presumed to still be somewhere inside the containment zone. Revision of special containment procedures is pending approval.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7634]]] | SCP-7635 | [[[SCP-7636]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=alanthechair]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** wombat.jpg\n> **Name:** wombat.jpg\n> **Author:** AustralianPhotos-In Action\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n> **Source:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wombat_from_Adelade.jpg\n> **Additional Notes:** Image is cropped\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
