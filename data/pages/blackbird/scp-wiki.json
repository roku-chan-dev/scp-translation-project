It’s the color one would see while taking a midnight stroll, and thinking about life and regrets.\n\nMichael Prescott knew a thing or two about regrets. He will also say, if asked, why his walls were colored the way they are. The color black educed a wide range of emotions in people, from fear of the unknown to mourning and emptiness. But it could also be associated with comfort and calming of the mind.\n\nThat’s what Michael designed it for—to make his patients comfortable.\n\nMichael was sitting in his office chair as usual, mindlessly scrolling from his phone to pass the time. There were the usual unhinged takes and news stories that he couldn’t be bothered with. Things were going well recently.\n\n//For now.//\n\nA knock on the door. They were here. He quickly shoved his phone in his pocket, and pulled out his clipboard and pen, awaiting his newest client.\n\nThe door cracked slightly open, and Michael’s newest patient slowly peeked their head into the room.\n\n“You may come in.”\n\nThe patient nodded, and pushed the door further open. They were a new arrival from Site-17, transferred over to Site-35 for a more extensive therapeutic treatment.\n\nFor one thing, they certainly looked like they came out of 17.\n\nThey were wearing a standard gray jumpsuit, with their designation bolded on their right sleeve. They looked jittery, their eyes dashing around the room as if looking for someone who wasn’t there. Their black hair was frazzled and messy, like it had never been combed in years.\n\n“Are you alright?” Michael asked with concern in his eyes.\n\n“N-no, I’m fine, don’t worry. It’s just, it’s been a lot.” The client looked over their shoulder, before looking back at Michael.\n\n“One relates. But I am here for you, and we can talk about whatever you like, no strings attached.”\n\nThe client nodded, before shifting in their seat. “Of course. My name’s Avery, by the way.”\n\nMichael reached out his hand. “It’s nice to meet you, Avery.”\n\nAvery reached out in kind, then slightly pulled their hand back, expecting something to happen. But Michael still waited. They eventually gripped his hand firmly and awkwardly shook it.\n\n“It’s nice to meet you too, sir.” Avery gave their best smile.\n\n“No need to call me that. There doesn’t need to be a hierarchy here. I’m just here to help.”\n\n“What do you want me to call you, then?”\n\nHe thought about it for a moment. “Just Michael would be fine, for now.”\n\n“Okay.” Avery slumped down in their seat.\n\n//Something seems off.//\n\nMichael switched his posture, keeping himself looking professional and sympathetic. His full attention was on Avery, and he tried his damndest to not strain his eyes.\n\nTo most, some things are automatically obtained for them. Most people would not have to keep constant check on tone, body language, facial expressions, the literal versus the figurative, semantics, and hidden social cues manually. But Michael was not most people.\n\nAnd that was okay, because he was himself.\n\n“Have you had any problems at your previous site? Anything particular that I need to know about?”\n\n“Uh…” Avery slumped down even further.\n\n“You can be honest with me. Nothing that you will say will leave this room,” Michael reassured them.\n\nAvery pulled themselves back up, and started to twiddle their thumbs. “I don’t know if I can say this.”\n\n“It’s alright if you can’t. I just want to know how you’re feeling.”\n\n“No, I literally //don’t know// if I can say this. What’s the difference between you and those other shrinks? I know that this stuff isn’t really between you and me.” Avery looked even more wary of the room around them.\n\n“I promise you, I am under strict confidentiality. You are safe here.”\n\n“Safe from what? Everything feels the same.”\n\n“Your mental health is my top priority. Our work here is to help you. I want you to feel safe.”\n\nAvery glared at him. “This is not safe, at all. And I don’t think being put in a room with concrete walls and barely anything to keep you company is exactly the best for someone’s mental health.”\n\nMichael suddenly became very aware of the sound of the air circulating above.\n\nHe sighed. “I know how that can feel. Like you’re suffocating. But we don’t do that here.”\n\nAvery gathered a bit more confidence. “Really? Is that true? Or is all this just a way to move me somewhere else so you can distract me from the fact that you’re violating //my rights// as a human being.”\n\nMichael could see the determination in their eyes. To be set free. It reminded him of his past work, where many similar conversations like this occurred.\n\n“You know what they told me, back at 17? ‘We take pride in getting to know our tenants, and their wellbeing is our number one priority.’ And they were //very concerned// about me in particular. But I know that’s just code for ‘we’re watching you at all times, punk.’ And you know the worst part? They had a saying where they were a ‘big, happy family.’ Christ.”\n\nMichael knew those feelings all too well. He heard similar stories by other clients over the years. It became a game by the other anomalies to see which site would be the worst to be contained in: 19 or 17. After overhearing their conversations, Michael frankly thought that it was a hard choice to pick.\n\nHe clasped his hands together. “I promise you, Avery, in this place we will do what’s best for //you//. Your cell won’t be a cell, it’ll be your room, and you will be free to roam around most of the facility at any time.”\n\nAvery raised an eyebrow. “So I can just walk around, with nobody watching my every move? You have to be joking.”\n\n“I am not.”\n\nFor a split second, Michael could see that Avery’s eyes flashed a bright green. The door to the office then slammed open, almost being knocked off its hinges. They turned their head to the door, spotting no one.\n\nThey turned their head back. “Coast is clear. Unless your security has fancy invisible tech.”\n\n“No one is going to watch you for any reason, Avery. We all have a right for privacy.”\n\nAvery shuffled in their seat. “This sounds too good to be true. How did they allow you to do any of these things? This just doesn’t sit right with me.”\n\n“Because since the beginning, we wanted to take care of those who needed a little help to live stable lives. Our procedures are lax because there is no threat from a single person in this facility, because why would they be a threat? It’s like what our founding director once said, you are not our subjects, you are our guests.’’ Michael attempted to place his hand on Avery’s shoulder, before being swatted away.\n\n“Guests? In a prison. Where I can never leave. What kind of Kool-Aid did they put you on?” Avery’s eyes burned with a fiery rage, a fury at a system that had hurt so many people time and time again. Michael immediately regretted having this entire conversation.\n\n//You’re slipping, Michael.//\n\nHe quietly tapped his foot with a lively, rhythmic beat. Sometimes he would spin his pen around in his fingers or rock back and forth to help him regulate himself. In times like this, he definitely needed it.\n\n“I know how you’re feeling. Believe me, when I first learned of our mission, I felt the same way. I can’t let you leave, we both know that. But I can help you live your life, even in a place like this.”\n\nAvery crossed their arms. “I think I get it now. Your straight white ass thinks it’s better to integrate us into this nonsense system so we can be ‘content’ and you can feel like you’re not participating in something so morally wrong. You probably haven’t had a single taste of what we experience in your life. Why not just leave? It’ll be better for you that way.”\n\n//Well, I’m not exactly-// He killed the thought before he could blurt it out loud.\n\n“I will not leave you at the hands of something that punishes you for being different. That was a vow I made to myself years ago. I was once like those other researchers. I once disregarded [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7550 a friend’s] feelings and prioritized his containment protocols over anything else. I will not make that same mistake again. I am here for you. Always.”\n\nSilence filled the room.\n\n“Do you think I deserve being like this?” Avery asked, gesturing to themselves.\n\n“You deserve to be you, no matter what.” Michael smiled warmly.\n\nAs they awkwardly waved goodbyes and the session ended, Michael had a thought that kept nagging him for quite a while.\n\n//Do I deserve to be myself, as well?//\n\nHe had that thought for as long as he could remember. It had been there since the start.\n\n----\n\n**2001**\n\nHe was a strange kid.\n\nWell, that’s what the other kids would call him. Weird. The nerd who collected Pokémon cards and shared them with the other outcasts of the school. The scrawny, timid one who’d pick grass at recess. The one who was practically an enigma to everyone else.\n\nHe never got picked on much by the other kids, but there was definitely an odd atmosphere in the classroom when he was around.\n\nHe was having a conversation with a kid named Cullen, a fellow like-minded Pokémon enthusiast. Mike’s favorite was Gengar, while Cullen’s favorite was Charizard, which he thought was a basic pick, just like vanilla ice cream. He always wondered why anyone would even pick vanilla as their favorite flavor.\n\nCullen turned to him. “So, what do you think about the new game coming up?”\n\nMike tilted his head. He tended to do that. “What new game?”\n\n“My uncle works for GameFreak. He says they're making a new one!”\n\n“Your uncle works for GameFreak?” Michael didn’t know that.\n\n“Yeah, he makes all the pixels and stuff.” Cullen tried to not burst into laughter, putting his hand over his mouth to stifle the giggling, or rather squeaking that he’d usually make.\n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, the gears finally turned in Mike’s head. “Okay Mickey, you got me.”\n\n“You always fall for this, Mike! You’re an easy target.”\n\nCullen was right about that. He was certainly gullible. A lot of things would go over his head just as high as the neck of a giraffe. Their necks could supposedly go all the way up to the clouds. At least, that’s what Cullen told him.\n\n“Well, it wasn’t very funny to begin with.”\n\nCullen grunted. “Think you can do better?”\n\nMike scratched his hair. “Sorry. I just don’t like when I’m the one being teased.”\n\n“I’m not //teasing// you, Mike. It’s just good fun. We can have fun together, right?”\n\nHe wanted to say something else, but he decided to let it go. “Yeah. Right.”\n\nCullen pulled his collection out. “Look what I got at the store yesterday. This is going to blow your mind.”\n\nHe looked at Cullen’s new cards. They weren’t particularly special, but he pretended to drop his jaw in amazement, for courtesy’s sake.\n\nThey ogled at the cards for a while before the bell rang, and they headed back to class. Though no one was looking at him, Mike could feel them staring regardless. He wondered why he felt like the shadows on the wall, wanting to become like the light but always being blocked by something else. He wondered about a lot of things.\n\nHe wondered why the other kids talked differently around him, and why they couldn’t just talk to him normally. Why they told him that he looked shifty when he wasn’t looking at them, even though that didn’t really matter in the first place with his lazy eye. Why they whispered to themselves behind his back. And he could never figure it out.\n\nHe had to tell someone about it. Maybe a trusted adult, like his teacher.\n\nWhen class was over, Mike ran up to Mrs. Knoth, and started to tug on her sleeve to get her attention. “Mrs. Knoth?”\n\nShe turned towards him. “Yes, Michael?”\n\nMike held his head down, and looked at the floor.\n\n“They hate me, don’t they?”\n\nThe teacher gasped, before leaning down to Mike’s line-of-sight, and placing her hands on his shoulders. “No one hates you, Michael.”\n\n“Then why do they talk to me like I’m an alien?”\n\n“Because you’re special, Michael. You’re different from everyone else, and that’s a //good thing//. You are smart, and you are kind. You’re going to do great things in the future, okay?”\n\nHe nodded. “Okay.”\n\nShe patted him on the head. “Now go have fun with the other kids. They won’t bite.”\n\nMike turned away from the teacher, and sulked back to his seat. He didn’t even bother. Because why would he? He could barely manage a conversation to save his life. And the other kids would tear him apart.\n\nMaybe he should be torn apart. Maybe that would get rid of what’s wrong with him.\n\n----\n\n**2024**\n\nThe fluorescent lights at the site always bothered Michael. They looked like someone deliberately manufactured the lights to try and make them look soothing and gentle, but the actual product never quite made the mark. The floral carpeting and the plaster walls weren’t much better, but Michael could sense the craftsmanship and that they at least tried with the overall design. It was the lights that frustrated him.\n\nNot as much as how he frustrated himself, but they were quite annoying.\n\nStill, he understood why they were there. To create an environment where the humanoids didn’t have to look at concrete halls and sterile labs while wandering around.\n\nOn the topic of wandering around, Michael was still kicking himself for lying to that kid. He was mostly correct about where the anomalies could go, but they were only restricted to the cafeteria, the section hosted by the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub Anomalous Entity Engagement Division] (the appropriately titled Playcare), and the designated lounges designed for the anomalies to relax together. They were not allowed to enter any of the research offices or the practical sectors without permission, they were not allowed to visit each other’s cells, and they were definitely not permitted to lollygag around the restricted areas of the site.\n\nFrankly, this wasn’t the worst thing that happened when he forgot something. But it wouldn’t be the last.\n\nHe eventually made his way to the cafeteria, where a whole host of interesting things were taking place. The security officers were all mingled in one table, most likely shit-talking their boss or discussing some other escapade they did while intoxicated. Michael’s friend Emily was there as well, sitting at the far corner at the table. He gave a little wave, and she beamed at him and waved fervently right back.\n\nThe researchers who weren’t nerdy enough to specialize in temporal or ectodimensional studies covered most of the seats, so Michael decided to head towards the convenient empty seat next to Emily. He would rather not sit at a crowded table with people he barely talked to.\n\nHe turned in that direction, before bumping into someone’s side. He didn’t see her coming towards him at all.\n\n“Sorry about that, I-” he tried to say, before being immediately interrupted.\n\n“You weren’t paying attention at all. Yeah, I can see that.” The woman smirked. She was a brunette, with hair that flowed down to her shoulders and a nasty grin that creeped Michael out. She was wearing the standard security officer uniform, which meant that Michael could easily guess why her behavior was so jarring and repugnant.\n\n“Yeah I didn’t mean to bump into you like that, it was an accident. That was all on me.”\n\n“Of course it was. So maybe //watch where you’re going// next time.” The officer harrumphed at him, which Michael did not think was a real thing that people could do, and grumpily stomped toward her seat.\n\nAfter standing there in silence for longer than he should’ve, Michael then remembered what he was supposed to do. Thankfully, the seat wasn’t taken.\n\n“Did you see what just happened to me back there?” Michael asked Emily.\n\n“Yep, that’s Vanessa for you,” Emily said, taking a bite out of her meatball sub.\n\nRight. Vanessa Hickman, that was her name. Emily told a lot of stories about her, but she told Michael a lot of stories that he probably didn’t need to hear about to begin with, so they all blended together in his head.\n\n“But I tried to be polite! It wasn’t even that bad,” Michael insisted.\n\n“Look, Mike, some people just don’t give a shit about anything. Not everyone’s going to give you the same respect that you give them.”\n\nShe was right on that. “I know, but I shouldn’t have bumped into her in the first place.”\n\nEmily patted him on the shoulder. “It’s alright Mike, it was just an accident. Let’s move on to something else.”\n\n“Alright.” But his mind was still focusing on the incident. He could’ve been more perceptive. If he looked //just a little bit further// to the left, none of it would’ve happened. And everything would go smoothly.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing would ever go smoothly for Michael. And he knew why. He always knew why.\n\nEmily snapped him back to reality. “You good?”\n\n“Of course. I’m regular.”\n\nShe snorted. “I never heard that from you. Regular?”\n\n“Yeah. Regular as every other day. I used to say that all the time in high school for some reason. I guess it now decided to come back in my head right at this moment,” Michael explained.\n\n“I’m going to put that in my vocabulary from now on. That is just too good,” Emily said, pointing at Michael with a French fry.\n\n“Well, whenever you need another of my random phrases, I’m right-” he was immediately interrupted by something bumping into his side.\n\n//At least it wasn’t me this time.// He turned towards the figure, and saw a small green figure with large, pointy ears and a recognizable golden fang.\n\n“Doctor! I didn’t see you there, my apologies.” The goblin gave a bow to acknowledge his offense.\n\n“Hi, Victor.” Michael frowned. Nothing ever good happened when Victor showed up.\n\n“Well, my good fellow, I was wondering if you would take part in another of my experiments. You see, I have this weapon that will turn anything in its path into chickens, and I wanted to see if you-”\n\nHe waved him off. “Sorry Victor, but I’m a little busy right now. I’ll see if I can come in next time.”\n\n“No worries, no worries! I have plenty of candidates to choose from. But I’ll get you next time, just you wait,” Victor proclaimed, waggling a finger at him and grinning maniacally.\n\nAnother individual rolled up in a wheelchair to grab Victor by the shirt collar.\n\n“Oh, hey Desmond,” Emily greeted him.\n\nThe bald, dark-skinned man with a scruffy beard waved with his other hand. “I’ll take him from here.”\n\n“Hey, what did I tell you about grabbing me like that? You’re my assistant, not my //butler//. Unhand me now, good sir!” Victor exclaimed, as he was dragged away by Desmond.\n\nEmily shook her head. “Man, I forgot how weird this place is sometimes.”\n\n“Not as strange as that time when that guy from 87 came to visit.”\n\n“You know what, I take it back. Nothing is ever going to beat whatever clusterfuck that was,” Emily concurred.\n\nMichael hoped she was right with that. For all he knew, his embarrassing mishaps had never been seen by anyone, and he kept it all to himself. For good reason.\n\nBecause how else would one live if they always dropped the ball, over and over again, with no end in sight? He doubted anyone would like to live a life like that.\n\nLike his.\n\n----\n\nHe had to get those pesky thoughts away, so he decided to divert the thoughts into a more positive direction.\n\nHe was standing in the research and experimentation sector, observing the several cramped desk spaces for researchers to conduct their tests and examine their samples. After successfully escorting a researcher back to her work after their session, he decided to take a break and watch the various happenings in the room.\n\nHe could see the vast ocean of people who he barely recognized, but he did know a few faces. There was the black-haired gentleman from New Jersey, who had plenty of things to say about his state. There was the girl with the Hello Kitty keychain on her purse, who was most known for her interesting music tastes and how she brightened up everyone’s day. And there was also the woman who used to work as a barista to help pay for her degree, before an anomalous accident at her workplace caused the Foundation to shut the place down and eventually recruit her.\n\nEach and every day, he wondered about these people’s lives. How they were as vivid and complex as his own, and how they existed around him like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to other lives that he’ll only be there for once, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, or as a lighted window at dusk.\n\nIt was spellbinding to him, how he’ll only see a glimpse of what kind of lives these people lived. Maybe that was why he liked his job so much, not just to help people, but also to see more glimpses of these hidden worlds that he would normally miss.\n\nHis daydream was immediately disrupted by a tap on the shoulder. He turned around, and saw someone who he did not want to see in the slightest.\n\nHe was a short, plump man with a hideous combover, and his skin looked very similar to a shriveled grape. His eyes sagged, and Michael either thought he was brought back to life from the dead, or he just never particularly aged well. He was Howard Bates, the head of Research & Experimentation.\n\nAnd he always worried Michael whenever he showed up, even more than Victor. At least with Victor, he knew what he was in for. But with Howard, he had no idea why his stomach always flared up whenever they met. And that worried him immensely.\n\nHoward held his hand up, like a half-attempt at waving. “Hey, Michael.”\n\nHe just stood there. “Hi.”\n\n“I’m glad to see you around. My juniors over here have been quite a hassle to deal with.” Howard gestured at his subordinates.\n\n“They’re JRs, so they’re still new to the job.”\n\nHoward shook his head. “No, I don’t think it’s just that. I have a very strict schedule when it comes to this line of work. These samples don’t last all day, and they have to //work// if they want to sort ‘em on time. It’s very difficult to do, and especially difficult if you //don’t bother at all//.”\n\nHe raised an eyebrow. “Does that indicate that you don’t particularly enjoy their…?”\n\n“Their mingling, yes. They have other times to socialize. Not during times of such importance as this.”\n\nMichael could see now why no one on R&E liked Howard. The scrupulous types weren’t to be reckoned with.\n\nHoward turned to look at his working lab rats, before turning back to Michael. “I have a question that’s been on my mind lately. How come I don’t see you around often?”\n\n//Shit.//\n\nMichael put his hands in his pockets. “I’m just busy doing my own work.”\n\n“Mmm. What else do you do outside of work?”\n\nHe didn’t have an answer to that. He clawed at himself internally to think of //something//, but there wasn’t much time.\n\n“Um, I do cardio around the perimeter of the site, and I talk to my friend.”\n\nHoward nodded. “Well, it’s good that you’re doing something with someone you care for. Now, how’s your Miss-Pretty-Pretty doing?”\n\nHis stomach tied itself into a knot. “You mean— Emily?”\n\n“Come on. I know you two have been together for a while.”\n\nMichael waved his hands around frantically. “It’s not like that! I’m not dating anyone yet! I’m not-”\n\n“You can be honest with me. I won’t tell anyone,” Howard attempted to assuage him, giving him a wink.\n\n“I’m //not//!” Michael snapped, before widening his eyes in the realization of how loud his voice echoed throughout the room. A few eyes were staring at him.\n\nHoward simply smiled, and turned to the distracted researchers. “Please get back to work.” They immediately went back to what they were doing without question.\n\nMichael’s hands were still shaking. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean— I should’ve been more forthright with you.”\n\n“No, I think your conviction was on point. I like you, Michael. You have something that a lot of people don’t. You have a keen mind. The knowledge you wield is a wonderful thing. Don’t let anyone else take that from you, or lead you astray. Too many have fallen for the wrong path. But you and I, we know what’s right from wrong.” Howard’s grin extended even further, and Michael could’ve sworn he heard his skin stretching.\n\nHe decided to exit the conversation prematurely. “Well, duty calls, so I have to go. Thanks.”\n\nAs he hurried out of the lab, Howard called out to him one last time. “I’m looking forward to seeing you again!”\n\nNo way was he going to do that. Not with him almost being outed. No way in hell.\n\nHe almost forgot about it. He barely told anyone, except for his brother, and he never really had to tell anyone else because being seen as a lonely loser was far better for him than the alternative. It brought back memories.\n\nIt also reminded him of something else.\n\n----\n\n**2007**\n\nHe was sitting on his family’s dusty old couch from ten or so years ago, torn and practically scratched to death by the family cats. It was dinner time, and he was eating hot dogs while watching the latest mediocre sitcom. Michael’s brother, Merek, was eyeing at him in the corner of the room. But he didn’t notice, as his mind was focusing on the TV in front of him.\n\nThe sounds around him were drowned out, and became muffled to the point of being nearly muted. His thoughts became a vivid canvas, flowing with colorful images and sounds. He was thinking about a lot of things lately. His future was gaining on him now more than ever.\n\nWhat would happen if he went to university? He did not know. His support systems would be gone, and he would have to fend for himself. Could he ever fend for himself? He did not know that either. His constant setbacks at home were already enough of a problem.\n\nHis thoughts started to race around his mind, going faster and faster. The what-ifs kept coming, but Michael could hear another muffled voice calling out to him. It grew louder, and louder, until—\n\n“Mike, for fuck’s sake!” Merek hollered at him.\n\n//Not again.//\n\n“Sorry about that.” Michael looked at him solemnly.\n\n“Looks like it’s 10 this time. What a record.” He chuckled to himself.\n\nMichael didn’t understand why this happened. Usually it occurred when he was reading a book, or watching comedy sketches on his smartphone. Every sound around him became a muddled mess, and he’d miss what other people would say to him.\n\nHe wondered when it was going to become a chore for them. It was already a chore for him. And Merek hated it since day one. But he didn’t like a lot of things.\n\n“Every time, man. Every time.”\n\n“You know I can’t just switch it on and off.”\n\n“Right. But can you at least //try// to do something about it?” Merek sneered.\n\n“I am trying.”\n\n“You’re not trying hard enough. I swear, you do the same shit every time and expect people to be patient with you, even though you’re not changing a bit. It can’t be that difficult.”\n\nMichael stared blankly at him. “It is.”\n\nMerek then put his fingers up, and began counting each one. “You keep forgetting to put your clothes in the dryer, or take them out and put them away. You keep forgetting to even //clean your glasses//. You don’t talk to anyone at school. You always fuck something up when you drive. And don’t even get me started on the time when you left your underwear on when we went to the pool. You’re a //mess//, Mike.”\n\n“I know. I know, I’m sorry. I know.” He hung his head down.\n\nMerek kept going. “Do you care, though? I don’t think you do. I think you’re just lazy. Maybe that’s all this is.”\n\nHe left it there. No one spoke until their father came into the room. Michael’s dad looked tired. Probably from work. He sat down and sighed heavily, his eyes fluttering as he tried to stay awake.\n\nMerek turned to the TV, and Michael did the same. They both pretended that the other person didn’t exist. Which was better than the alternative. Michael tried to focus on the show this time.\n\nIt eventually got to a point where commercials came on. There were the random drug ads, the fast food places, the unimportant clothing products, and the occasional commercial where Michael would perk up and actually listen to what was being advertised. He especially loved the theme park promotions, those were exciting and fun.\n\nHis attention began to wade, until his dad turned his head to him and pointed at the screen in front of him.\n\n“You see that, Mike? That’s the good stuff right there.” He winked.\n\nMichael was about to point out that his dad was still married, but decided against it. He turned toward the screen.\n\nIt was a lingerie commercial. Because of course it was. The women were showing off their bras and panties for all the onlookers to see. Merek started staring intently in a certain direction, but he did that with both genders so Michael just ignored him.\n\nBut he didn’t get it. What was the point of this commercial? To entice people? He guessed it worked, but somehow not for him.\n\nHe saw it everywhere. Everyone would bring it up, no matter when or where. Some people were obsessed with it, and made Michael extremely uncomfortable. The only thing he could reasonably compare it to was a donut, and hunger was the attraction. Michael did not want the donut, nor was he hungry. He wondered if he would ever be hungry in this situation.\n\nAfter going with this analogy, he started thinking about how other people could theoretically fit in it. Some people could be hungry, and not eat the donut, instead settling with something else to eat. Perhaps they wouldn’t be hungry, but they will gladly eat the donut anyway. Perhaps neither, like him.\n\nOr perhaps he needed a better analogy.\n\nBut his wondering persisted, and went in new directions. If he was the only person who felt this way, people would most likely see him in a different light. He wondered how his parents would feel. They accepted Merek, but non-attraction was a separate thing entirely. He wondered how the world would think of him. He did not fit that specific mold that they required, so the systems in place would most likely batter him or ignore his existence. It was a certainty.\n\nBut this wasn’t much of an issue for him. He dealt with the side glances before. He could handle the suspicion, and the name-calling.\n\nBut could he handle it twice as much? Most likely not. So he put on his mask and left it at that. After all, he was a good pretender.\n\n----\n\nThe cool autumn breeze flowed through Michael as he did his morning jog around the perimeter of the site. He needed the reprieve from his daily blunders, and fall had the best weather for this purpose. Michael could never stand the heat, and he only liked winter because he could stay indoors to drink a nice cup of hot chocolate. But spring and fall were the in-between seasons, and fall especially had that fresh and crisp weather that made it perfect for his workouts.\n\nAs he rounded his last lap, he saw people clocking in to the site for the day. One man waved to him, and he waved in return, before heading to the side entrance of the site and stopping the timer on his phone.\n\nHe thought about the guy waving at him. Did he know him? Well, maybe he did, everybody did since Michael was the head psychologist. But did he //know// him?\n\nMichael honestly forgot that he wasn’t an enigma anymore. He had a presence, and he did his job well. But outside of work, he wouldn’t go out of his way for conversation. He knew the names of many people, but people were more than just names. Each person had their own storybook, with the chapters of their lives filled with many tales, some of which were amusing anecdotes, while others were more disheartening. But they all equally fascinated him. Stories were his lifeblood, his way to see the world, his way to connect. And they were why he had this job in the first place.\n\nTo see how people ticked, and to help write their stories so that they wouldn’t feel alone.\n\nAs he wandered through the plaster hallways, he saw more people making their way to their specific sections. People he could talk to. But even if he tried, everything would remain the same.\n\nHis social skills were inadequate, and conversations would pass by him with the wind. And he tried. He always tried. But when the only advice he ever got in his life regarding this was ‘just talk more,’ after a certain point he didn’t even bother.\n\nHe had all the opportunities to meet new people, to make new friends, and he never did. College and high school were a blur to him. And after that, he got picked up by the Foundation, but still, nothing would change.\n\nHe had to change. He couldn’t be a static point in an ever-evolving world. But what could he even do?\n\nHe sat on that thought as he made his way to his office, to prepare for his next session. He couldn’t achieve what he wanted by default. There was always something blocking him from living a life that’s not filled with constant oversights. And he knew what it was. Of course he knew what it was. He had an entire PsyD to figure it out. But even with all that knowledge, it still kept coming, to ruin his life at every waking moment.  \n\nHe checked the time. It was getting close. Good thing he was prepared—\n\nWait.\n\nA familiar feeling crept from the back of his mind. Something was off. He missed something. But what?\n\nHe looked around the room, and on his person. Phone, check. Documentation, check. Glasses, check. Pen, pen, where was the pen? Oh.\n\nHe missed his pen and clipboard.\n\n“You fucking //moron//!” he bellowed, before immediately throwing himself into a sprint towards his dormitory. Instead of just leaving his stuff in his office, he left it in his personal quarters. Again.\n\nHe ran like hell through the halls, catching a few odd glances from a few researchers, but he paid no mind to them. He had to get his stuff.\n\nMichael slammed the door open, and immediately started throwing his stuff around the room, not caring if he would break anything. That was something that future him could worry about.\n\nHe paced around the room, smacking his forehead over and over again. How could he forget something as simple as a //clipboard// and a //pen//?\n\nEventually, he found them. They were hiding in one of his drawers, for reasons that he failed to recall. Because of course he did. But he had to focus. He snatched the clipboard and pen, and went right back into his sprint.\n\nEmily always joked that if the site had a 100-meter-dash competition, Michael would easily get first place. He didn’t think he would be the winner, but he could go quite fast. The problem with that was the immediate consequence of complete and utter exhaustion, which would definitely be a disadvantage for him.\n\nHe ran through the corridors and skidded through tight corners, until the final stretch, where he successfully entered his office with only minutes to spare. He breathed deeply, and nearly stumbled into his desk as he made his way to his chair, with clipboard and pen in hand.\n\nHe checked his calendar off for the day. Once Avery’s session was over, he could relax. Regardless of how limited it was, Michael found his finite free time valuable, so he could ignore the clawed hands of reality for just a moment.\n\nThe door to the office opened once more, and Avery stiffly stepped towards the reclined chair across from Michael.\n\n“Welcome back, Avery! I’m glad you could make it to our session today.”\n\nThey crossed their arms. “Yeah. I’m getting used to it, I guess.”\n\nHe tapped his pen against the clipboard. “Are you having any trouble adjusting to your environment?”\n\nThey scoffed. “How can I adjust to //a cell//? But maybe. I don’t really talk to the others.”\n\n“Hm. Perhaps I can arrange a group activity?”\n\nThey shook their head. “If it’s anything like those group projects at school, then fuck that.”\n\n“Let’s not go with that, then. I wasn’t fond of icebreakers either. But I will figure this out with you.”\n\nThey nodded, before staring at Michael’s glasses for a second. “Sorry if this sounds rude, but I think your glasses look a little dirty.”\n\n“Oh, you’re fine, I actually prefer a little honesty, I do sometimes miss these things. I’ll clean them when we’re done, thanks.” He put up his facade to not make them feel guilty.\n\nThe lenses in Michael’s glasses were cheap plastic, so he had to clean them in the morning every day. Otherwise they would be smudged for the whole day. Thing was, no one except for his immediate family ever pointed it out to him. Michael concluded that it was either because they were too nice to be blunt with him, or they went on with their lives instead of having to worry about trivialities.\n\nHe wished he could have that sense of indifference. But that was for him to figure out. For now, his work must proceed as usual.\n\nIt proceeded as it always did. He never really had a chance to do anything otherwise.\n\n----\n\n**2008**\n\nThe summer months before what would become Michael’s adult life were short and unfulfilling. With his unparalleled wisdom, Michael decided to not take a summer job and instead do nothing throughout the summer. He had nowhere to go, and no friends to go with. He was stuck, trapped in a house that he did not want to be in.\n\nHis brother had his head in his hands, with a stack of paper and a calculator on the countertop. Michael would’ve tried to help him, if not for the fact that Merek had multiple AP courses, and the homework he was working on currently was calculus. Michael was never much of a math person.\n\nHe went to go grab a snack from the fridge, eyeing Merek warily as he mumbled several profanities and kept smacking the counter with his palm. After a while, he decided to say something.\n\n“So, uh, you good?” Michael asked.\n\nAn acidic smile grew on Merek’s face. “What do you think? I’m in the middle of something here.”\n\nHe sat down next to him. “Math again?”\n\nMerek sighed. “Yep. My teacher is a real piece of work. You know the one who looks like she was in the same class as Jesus? Always blabbering on and on about her dog or whatever. Her class is so //boring//.”\n\nRight, Mrs. Roth. The teacher in retirement age with those really tiny reading glasses who hadn’t retired yet for some reason. Michael heard many things about her class, including how strict she was.\n\nMerek turned to look at him. “Any other reason for why you want to bother me?”\n\nMichael rubbed his neck. “Uh, not really, I just wanted to see how you’re doing.”\n\n“Whatever. Anywho, did you do your homework today?”\n\nHe hadn’t, but he nodded his head anyway. “Yeah, I did.”\n\n“Great. Awesome. By the way, I saw someone today that reminded me of you. Hang on, let me draw ‘em for you real quick.” Merek grabbed his pencil, and started to hastily scribble on a piece of paper.\n\nWhen he was done, he gave the paper to Michael. He squinted his eyes to see a crude drawing of a wolf-like person or a person in a wolf-costume. Text next to the drawing read ‘this is you.’\n\nHe frowned. “Very funny.”\n\n“Hey, you’re not denying it.”\n\n“What did I do to deserve that?”\n\nMerek snorted. “What did you do, huh? You want a full list of every stupid thing you’ve done?”\n\nMichael clenched his fist. “I’m not stupid.”\n\n“Yeah, you are. You fuck up everything. And you don’t ever listen to me. Remember when you walked outside and shut the door on me //while I was still talking//?”\n\n“I didn’t mean to do that to you. I had to take the dog out.” Michael visibly looked shaken.\n\n“You could’ve waited until I was finished. And you should learn how to take care of yourself better.”\n\n“I’m literally fine. I can handle myself. I’m not slow, I just can’t do what everyone else can.”\n\n“No, you just don’t think things through. I’m worried for you, man. Are you going to end up like those 30-year-old man-children who live in their parent’s basement and have to wear diapers? I will be very surprised if you don’t come back crying from college.” The venom in Merek’s voice seemed to grow louder as he spoke.\n\n“Is that really what you think of me? Am I that pathetic to you?”\n\n“Yes. I don’t see why that’s a problem here. You only care about yourself, anyway.”\n\nMichael’s eyes burned with a boiling hot fury. “And the pot called the kettle black.”\n\nTwo things immediately happened in succession. First, in a blind rage Merek threw his pencil in Michael’s direction, causing him to weave out of the way. Then, Michael started to quickly walk backwards down the hallway, keeping his eyes on his brother.\n\n“Tell me the truth. Do you hate me? I know I've been a jerk sometimes, but I can fix that. I’ll try to be better. Do you //hate me//?”\n\nHe didn’t answer. For a few moments, everything is silent. Once the pause became far too awkward, Merek cleared his throat and looked at Michael dejectedly.\n\n“I hope you find someone worth listening to.” And he left it at that.\n\nMichael turned away from his brother, and sulked upstairs to his bedroom. He couldn’t deal with him anymore. He tried to tell his father, but all he told him was to just ignore his brother’s verbal bombardments. This, as expected, did not help at all. But he wasn’t too worried about it anymore. He was more concerned about what Merek would do to other people like him. Because it was clear that he wouldn’t change his position in the slightest.\n\nMichael could only hope that one day, someone would put his brother in his place.\n\n----\n\nAs Michael looked back on these moments of his life, he recalled a certain conundrum that he could not understand at first.\n\nHe knew the intersection between his mind and his heart, what he felt and what he thought, and how they were unique from each other yet similar in how he could be disadvantaged by them. He recognized that he could be seen as a child because of either, not grasping with the way that the world works. But he understood it plenty, and he detested the systems that kept it turning.\n\nWhat he did not understand was the why. Why must the world around him treat him this way? He was always curious on how exactly that internal switch to complete hatred worked. Michael had never been so free to be who he was, and yet there was always a possibility where one would not see him that way.\n\nHe remembered reading one interview years ago, where a researcher told a contained anomaly, who was also an activist for asexuality before their containment, that they had an obligation to disclose if they weren’t dating someone, and that as a carbon-based life form and as a vertebrate, they also had an obligation to disclose that they were actually a jellyfish.\n\nThat callous remark, that clear disregard for the humanity of a fellow person made him incredibly uncomfortable, but his intrigue started to slowly increase over time, snowballing to where it is now.\n\nHe started to see the connections, where the strings were tied together to form this gigantic, suffocating knot of depravity. And he traced the lines to the source. It encompassed everything haunting him, and haunting others like him.\n\nAnd he was working for an organization that benefited from and actively promoted it.\n\nIt never sat well with him, but he kept doing his duty, knowing full well who he was working for. He was promised that he could help people, and he did the best he could, but in a place like the Foundation, would that be of much use at all? He should’ve left the second he found out the truth. But he didn’t. Maybe it was naivety that kept him back. Or maybe it was an obligation, to help those trapped within the margins to feel like themselves, to make them feel safe in a place that would much rather like to slowly tie a tourniquet around their necks.\n\nAs he pondered on this while standing awkwardly in the middle of a hallway, he felt a familiar tap on his shoulder. He turned around, and saw the devil staring back at him.\n\nHoward was leaning against the wall, hands in his pockets. “So, how’s it going?”\n\nMichael placed his hands in his pockets to match him. “Nothing much. I’m doing fine.”\n\nHoward nodded. “Good, that’s good. How’s your girlfriend?”\n\n//Don’t even bother.// “She’s good.”\n\n“Well, I’m glad to hear it. Say, you want to take a quick walk with me?”\n\nHe didn’t want to, but there wasn’t exactly anything that he had to do at the moment, and he didn’t want to be rude. So he simply nodded.\n\n“Well then, let’s go.” Howard beckoned him over. Michael made sure to keep his distance, slowly trailing from behind.\n\n“It’s been… interesting, these past few years. I feel like I’m finally settling down, floating through the moment. It feels different. I’ve been working for who knows how long.”\n\nMichael said nothing. Howard did not acknowledge this and kept talking.\n\n“I’m 58 years old, Michael. I’m nearing the end. But you, you still have some strut to your step. You have your years.”\n\nMichael nodded along, not wanting to provoke him. “Yeah.”\n\nHoward stopped for a moment, before turning to Michael. “You know what that means? It means you can continue the work. It means that you can still achieve great things. And eventually, you too will settle down with your Miss-Pretty-Pretty and live a happy life.”\n\nMichael tried not to wince. “Of course. I will make every effort available to me to do so.”\n\n“You already have. Your mind just won’t let you see it.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?” Michael raised an eyebrow.\n\n“I checked your personnel file. It told me everything that I needed to know. But hey, it’s okay. I know it’s hard. But you can work to alleviate that blockage, so you can live like us. You don’t have to be what you are now. Like I said, you have a keen mind, and I don’t think you want to have anything stopping you from using your potential. Some of the ‘smart’ people in this place can’t even tie their own shoelaces. They’re too lazy. They have lazy brains. They hate to learn new things outside the narrow categories of knowledge they’ve claimed for themselves. Do you want that, Michael? Do you want to be lazy like them?”\n\nThe world around him slowed to a crawl. He felt like time was moving backwards. Howard’s voice became nothing more than gibberish. He felt sick. His stomach started to boil, like he was being dunked in liquid gold. And he couldn’t do anything. He thought nothing. He didn’t move, or even blink. He let the vile words pass through him.\n\nHoward didn’t seem to notice, or even care. “You yourself are a therapist, right?”\n\nMichael reluctantly decided to continue along. “Yes. I’m the head of the division.”\n\n“Of course, of course! How could I forget? Sorry, I don’t remember names that well.”\n\n“It’s fine.” It wasn’t. Was he really just a no-name?\n\n“But anyway, I’m glad you’re here. Maybe one day, you can make this place even better than it was.”\n\nMichael wondered when this conversation was going to end. “How, exactly? I think we’re doing fine.”\n\n“We can do more. We own the world. We can do //so much more//. We still have that border problem down south. Too many illegals. Too much crime. We can put a stop to that, and yet we don’t. What do you think that makes us?”\n\nAnd he thought it couldn’t get worse. “Apathetic?” he responded.\n\n“Much worse. Stagnant. None of these people here care. They’re more willing to pride themselves as being a bunch of moral busybodies. But we know what’s right from wrong. And I hope you don’t let them tear you apart.” Howard put a hand on his shoulder. “I hope you will succeed where I have failed.”\n\nMichael couldn’t take it anymore. “I’ll do my best.” And he walked slightly faster past Howard, but not too fast. He prayed that he wouldn’t be interrupted again.\n\nOnce he was down the hallway, he looked over his shoulder one last time. Howard was still standing there, and although Michael couldn’t see it, he was smiling like a proud father.\n\n----\n\n**2002**\n\nHis brain was wracked with sounds and ideas.\n\nHe tossed and turned in his quaint little bed, but he couldn’t get himself to fall asleep. Maybe that was the issue. His father always told him to not force himself to sleep, because it would never work like he wanted to, and he would be even more awake than he was. But sometimes, he wouldn’t fall asleep even if his mind was clear. He couldn’t grasp why. Didn’t everyone else fall asleep in five minutes or so? Why not him?\n\nHe tried to distract the thoughts with a catchy tune. It began to wriggle inside his brain and make itself a nest. The melody would repeat itself, over and over again, slowly contorting into an ear-splitting version of itself. He had to change it, so he started to think about another song. But it, too, began to recur. He wanted to tear his hair out.\n\nIt shouldn’t be this hard. Michael never understood why people would stay up late. For the fun of it? How was any of it fun? He felt miserable every time he slept past 12. Twice he slept past 4, and it felt like he was beaten to a pulp for the entire day after.\n\nMaybe he was forcing it again. But he couldn’t unforce it, really. He didn’t want to, but he had to wake them. He promised to his father that he wouldn’t do it again. But he had to. He didn’t know what else to do.\n\nWith a sigh of exhaustion, he slowly pulled his covers up and stood up on the floor. While sauntering over to his parents room, he felt a twinge of guilt wash over him. But he couldn’t go back now.\n\nHe grabbed the handle, and intentionally opened the door so that it would squeak as loud as possible. Immediately, there was a groan coming from the far end of the room. It worked.\n\nHe tiptoed into the room, seeing his father stare disappointingly at him. “Go back to bed, bud.”\n\n“I can’t go to sleep. I’m sorry,” Michael whimpered.\n\nHis father sighed. “I told you, bud, you’re overthinking it. Just calm down. Drink some water. You’ll fall asleep eventually, okay?”\n\n“Okay.” He nodded. But he still stood there.\n\nMichael’s mother perked up her head, noticing his sad, beady eyes staring back at her. She looked at her husband. “I’ll take care of it, okay?”\n\nHe pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes. “As long as he doesn’t come back. I need my eight hours.”\n\nMichael turned, and walked dejectedly back to his room. He slipped under his covers once more, and turned to see his mother standing in the doorframe, with a hand behind her back.\n\nTears started to form in his eyes. “I can’t sleep, mom. I don’t know what to do.”\n\nShe smiled softly, to try and cheer him up. “I know it’s hard. There are some days where I can’t sleep either. I get too worried about a lot of things. But you know what I do when I can’t sleep? I hold onto what I love, and think about those things before I drift into my dreams.”\n\nMichael looked at the floor. “Am I broken, mom?”\n\nShe looked increasingly worried. “No, no, not at all! You’re a wonderful person, Mike. You can do great things. I know it feels like your wings are clipped, and you can’t fly like the rest of the flock. But you’re strong. You can get through anything. No matter what, you can soar as high as you want, without anyone stopping you. My little blackbird.”\n\nHis mother pulled out her acoustic guitar from behind her back, and began to play her favorite song. Michael knew it well. He knew it so well that he memorized the exact chords that started the song. G, Am7, G/B, C, D…\n\nHis mother did not sound like Paul McCartney at all, but her singing was so wonderfully alto that he couldn’t help but flutter his eyes and drift to sleep.\n\nHis dreams were pleasant, and he flew high in the sky, feeling the sun’s warmth on his skin. For just this moment, he was free, and it was beautiful.\n\n----\n\nMichael could never get rid of those troublesome nights. Not even where he was at now.\n\nIt was approximately 3:00 in the morning. He felt like he had a fever. He tried to change his position every few minutes, to see if that would change anything. But as he expected, it didn’t. His sheets were caked with sweat, and he heard the clock tick, and tick, and tick. It drove him up the wall.\n\nMichael sat up, gazing downward at the far end of the bed. He was running in circles, and he fully knew why. He knew the issue, the source to all of his problems, he researched it himself when he got his degree. But even after every session where he helped his clients figure themselves out, he never found a way to do the same for himself. It should’ve been obvious, hell he could’ve looked for the techniques that he needed to manage the damn thing. But he didn’t.\n\nHe shouldn’t have to worry about encroaching the same errors, every day without end. He shouldn’t have to keep acting with his mask, because he could never read the script, while being expected to know all the lines. He shouldn’t have to wrestle with a mind that was structurally built to thwart him throughout it all.\n\nHe shouldn’t have to live in a world that hated him.\n\nAnd he could see the signs. Oh, he could //see// it. The idea of laziness being a person just trying to survive, the mocking of people and their interests to make others feel better about themselves, and characteristics of disability being used as a cheap punchline. It put thoughts into kids’ heads in the media, and it was ingrained into language and culture.\n\nMichael was rather lucky that he was only seen as a ghost. And that pained him the most. He could see that some did not have the same fate.\n\nDespite all that, he was still behind the curve. He felt like he would always be behind the curve. He couldn’t let his friend down. He couldn’t let any of them down. He dug that hole too deep, and now he couldn’t see where his future would become.\n\nThe only thing that he felt useful for was his job. That was the singular, most important thing that defined him. It was what everyone knew him as. The guy who reached his hand out to help others up. And if that was all he was, it was better than being nothing at all.\n\nHe looked at the clock. It was 3:10 now. He didn’t know what to do. He checked his phone, to see if his friend was awake. Apparently, she was. What for? Who knows.\n\nHe had to distract himself, so he turned the brightness on his phone to the lowest setting and began to meticulously form a message to send. He had to make sure to not say anything wrong.\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**Michael**\nHello.

The distraction definitely helped take his mind off things, but he needed to get some rest, sooner rather than later. So he lied back down and turned to the wall. His dad was right with one thing. He was always an overthinker.\n\nOver the years, he tried taking melatonin, doing breathing exercises, anything to help him sleep. But none were very effective. All he could do was shut down the thoughts and let his body do the rest. It was harder than it looked, but it was the only thing that worked for him.\n\nAfter an agonizing few minutes, his brain finally gave up on him. The last thought he had before he felt that familiar drift was how much he missed his mom.\n\n----\n\nThe next morning was the same as before, and the weeks after were painfully mundane and tedious for Michael. He was starting to feel the monotony of it all, every waking moment was him going to a session, eating, talking to Emily if she had the time, then heading off to bed. Almost nothing interesting happened, and he identified the root of the issue immediately.\n\nIt was himself. His lack of communication in anything other than his job and his refusal to go out and meet new people had caused him to get himself stuck in a rut. He was always stuck in this rut. There were long stretches of time where he didn’t have anyone but himself to rely on. Sometimes, it felt like the swirling currents of change would pull him under and try to drown him, forcing him to never step out of what he considered safe. But Michael knew it was mostly all him. He was fortunate enough to still have one person by his side.\n\nBut what if that changed? What if, one day, he  would do something so moronic, so dickish that the only person who truly understood him pushed him away for good? He had no idea why she was still around him. He always fucked things up, at every turn, at every second of every day. He could not compute why she would keep caring for the burden that he was.\n\nBut there was no time to think about that now. Howard’s shadow still eclipsed over him and the whole site. The only way to heal the festering wound would be to excise the infection. And that was where he was going now, into the lion’s den. So he could find more evidence to finally eject the beast from his domain.\n\nHis stride became more assured, and his eyes were filled with determination as he weaved past a large flock of researchers. There was only one thought on his mind. He would not let anyone else live through the vicious mockery that he had to endure. Never again.\n\nWhen he reached the research sector, he walked to the edge of the balcony and observed the worker drones as they inspected their samples. He could see the head honcho, waving his arms around and directing the group like a director of a symphony orchestra. He meandered down to the disarray of test tubes and pipettes, and slowly inched his way to his target. After a moment of hesitation, he tapped Howard on the shoulder. It felt nice that he was the one to take him by surprise this time.\n\nHoward instinctively turned around. “Good afternoon, Michael.”\n\n“You as well, Howard.” Michael put his hands behind his back.\n\n“What brings your presence here, o’ healer of the mind?” Howard teased him.\n\nThis was already going great for him. “I need you for a second. Director wants me to have a quick review with you about your performance lately. Now, it’s nothing unpleasant, I assure you of that, but she wants to check in on you to see how you’re doing,” Michael lied.\n\nIf he knew of his deception, Howard didn’t look like it. “Ah, well, now’s about the time they start looking into me, eh?”\n\nMichael nodded. In response, Howard gestured toward the ramp. “Well, let’s get going,” he said.\n\nThey walked together to Howard’s office, Michael slightly trailing behind as usual. His stomach flared up like never before, and he could not wait to get out of this situation as soon as possible.\n\nThey entered the office, which was a sterile, Foundation-standard looking room, with a desk, a computer and a fake plant on top of a shelf. It didn’t surprise Michael at all that Howard’s office would be this mundane.\n\nHe sat down on his chair, and indicated to Michael to do the same. “So, what’s the dealio?”\n\nMichael almost tapped on the desk with his fingers, but thankfully stopped himself from doing so. “We were definitely noticing your efficiency with your work. Your leadership is on point. So, I am wondering if you can provide some insights for me so that future generations of our researchers can understand what it's like to be in your position. What it’s like to do what you do.”\n\nHoward pulled the chair forward, and sat there pondering the question. “Hm. Well, I don’t think it has to do with other people. Frankly, other people should be the least of your worries. My qualities as a leader comes from the fact that I do what I can for the Foundation. I have my convictions, and I hold them steadfast as I navigate these muddy waters. Some don’t think that way, but I think they don’t do enough.”\n\n“Care to elaborate?” Michael queried.\n\n“Of course. I don’t mind my fellow men, but they just do what they’re told to do. They don’t think of the bigger picture. They don’t think of how the world is being pulled apart by the seams by bad actors who are convinced that they have a right to control what we believe or say. Some of these people have too much say. And I think we should do better to hold //our own// convictions as an organization.”\n\n//There it is.// Michael slowly reached his hand into his pocket, and silently switched off the recording device kept within. He continued the faux-interview for another few minutes.\n\nOnce he was satisfied, he clasped his hands together. “Well, I think that’s all I need from you. Thank you for allowing me to do this.”\n\nHoward shook his head. “No need to thank me. You know what you’re doing.”\n\nMichael swiveled around with his chair, and got up and left the room, laughing to himself in his head as he closed the door.\n\n----\n\nHe was in his friend’s room. They were sitting on her couch, watching a funny video of her as a young child falling flat on her face. They were laughing so hard that Michael could see Emily’s face turning bright red.\n\nMichael tried to calm himself, but he couldn’t stop laughing. “You good?”\n\nShe took a swig of her water, and breathed deeply. “Man, was I a dumb kid.”\n\nHe held his bottle of water up. “True that.” They clinked their bottles together, though no clinking sound was made.\n\nMichael laid against the couch. His face grew blank, and he started to stare at the wall. He enjoyed these fleeting moments with his friend, but they were, as everything in his life at this point was, fleeting. They slipped away from his grasp like sand. He wanted to hold onto them for just a bit longer.\n\nHe could see the problem now. He was always going to be behind everyone else. Some of that was by design, of course. But he couldn’t live with being stuck in place, while everyone else got to move forward. He was proud of everyone in his facility and their accomplishments, but he couldn’t help but feel shame for not being able to achieve the same.\n\nThankfully, he shook out of that thought fast enough to not make Emily worried. She turned to look at him, and by the look of her eyes he could tell that she was eager to recite to him another story.\n\n“You know that party on Saturday I went to with my friends? Olivia was so shitfaced that she vomited towards the toilet. Not in it, //towards// it. It didn’t quite make it, and then she didn’t even notice that someone was already leaving the bathroom just as she entered it. So it got all over his pant leg!”\n\nMichael felt a familiar sensation, one where he knew of something he was supposed to remember but not the details. He saw the outline, but never the actual content. His brain itched him to figure it out, but he couldn’t make heads or tails of it.\n\n“Right, that party.” He slowly nodded. “I don’t quite recall that.”\n\n“I invited you to go, remember? But you declined. I get it, you were probably busy.”\n\nThe memory jolted him, sending shockwaves through his core. He did remember. He thought she wasn’t inviting him to the party, just that she was going there with her friends. And he simply replied that he hoped she had fun. He couldn’t believe that he would miss another opportunity like that.\n\nEmily immediately noticed his eyes widening. “Something wrong?”\n\nHe decided to be honest. He couldn’t hide anymore. “I didn’t think you were inviting me. I missed it. It’s like vampire rules, I’m not going anywhere unless you invite me by name. That’s my bad.”\n\n“You’re good, you’re good. I should’ve been more clear with you. But hey, I’ll tag you on my next thing, so it’s fine.”\n\n“It’s not fine,” he blurted. His logical side wasn’t in control anymore. “It’s me. It’s always me, and we both know it.”\n\n“It wasn’t your fault. Some things you just can’t control.”\n\n“I fucking //was in control//! And I didn’t respond like I should have. I know what’s been affecting me all my life. I know what it is. And I can’t even put it down. It has me by the throat, every day, and I can’t do anything about it.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean you’re at fault. That doesn’t make you a bad person for just making a mistake.” Emily looked at him with pity. Well, it certainly looked like that to Michael, the poor miserable creature that he was.\n\nHe tried his hardest not to burst into tears. “I always screw things up. Every time. Could you imagine having to make the same mistake, over and over again, even though you know how to learn from it? It could be past behind you, but it’s not. It’s always there. And everyone’s going to laugh at me, because I can’t make this right.”\n\nHis thoughts raced through his mind, going faster and faster. He could’ve done more to learn from his past errors and move on to greener pastures, but he didn’t. It cost him everything, because he failed. He always did, and he could’ve done more—\n\nEmily stopped him. “I know. You told me everything. But no one’s going to laugh at you. They’ll treat you with that in mind. They’ll treat you like a person. And if they don’t, they’re a bunch of suckers.”\n\nHe sniffled. “I’ve been a bad friend. I could’ve done more. I’m sorry.”\n\n“You’re a great friend, Mike. You’ve always been there for me. I think it’s about time I should be there for you too.”\n\nHe smiled, but only just a little. “I think it’s because I didn’t want you to leave me. Because of my thing, and because I know you’re going to fall in love with someone else. You’re going to get married, and I’ll still be there, but the feeling will be different. You know what I mean. I’ll just always be everyone’s second favorite person.”\n\nEmily wrapped her arms around him, and embraced him as tightly as she could. “I’ll never leave you behind. Never. I promise you that.”\n\nMichael liked the assurance with that statement, but he knew it wouldn’t last forever. “Do I deserve this? Any of it?”\n\nShe slightly pulled away from him. “Yes. You worked hard for this. You worked so hard to get here.”\n\n“Is that all I am? The therapist? That’s all they see of me.”\n\n“They don’t see you as just that. It’s not like you’re a nobody.”\n\nHe looked at the floor. “But what if I am?”\n\n“Then why would I be here, with you? Why wouldn’t you be the head of an entire division of our site?”\n\n“I’m just going through the motions, and you probably picked me up and adopted me because you saw that I had no one else.” Michael’s veins nearly popped in frustration.\n\n“I ‘adopted you’ because I saw a friend. You shouldn't have to be so hard on yourself.”\n\n“You’re right. I shouldn’t. I shouldn’t be so selfish. I can’t be effective at my job if I’m acting like this.”\n\nEmily put her hands on top of his. “You’re not selfish, Mike. You’re not.”\n\nHe finally made eye contact with her, his eyes heavy and dejected. “I’m 34 years old, and I’m still like this. I thought it would eventually give up. But maybe that was just me.”\n\n“You didn’t give up. You never did.”\n\n“I think that’s the only part where you’re wrong. I let myself go. I’ll do my best to course correct. I’m sorry.” Michael looked at her one last time. She looked happy. She always looked happy. He didn’t want to ruin that. So he got up, and left.\n\nMaybe she would be better off without him.\n\n----\n\nThere were two things he had to do. One, get rid of Howard. And two, rid himself from the people around him.\n\nHe marched toward the director’s office, a fire burning in his eyes, as he made his way throughout the twisting corridors and the hollow halls of the site. There was no turning back now.\n\nHe turned to the hall where the office resided, which a containment cell formerly occupied, before it got transmogrified into a 10 x 10 meter cavern, and eventually became the office and main residence for the director.\n\nHe was about to reach for the door, when he spotted a familiar face in the hallway. Howard was walking down the hall, whistling an unrecognizable tune. Michael stopped in his tracks. He should’ve kept his head down and continued walking, but he didn’t.\n\nHoward noticed his presence, and stopped as well. He looked blissful, and pensive at the same time. “It’s been a pleasure.”\n\nMichael tilted his head. He never really got rid of that habit. “What do you mean?”\n\nHoward smiled. “I’m headed off to greener pastures. I’m transferring to 17 in a few days. Before I close this chapter in life, I finally get to use my fullest potential.”\n\nHe couldn’t believe it. He just stood there, completely and utterly dumbfounded.\n\nHoward, like always, kept talking. “It’s truly been a pleasure to see you get so far in your career. You’ve done well. Most are lucky to even achieve a fraction of what you do. I think your future is looking very bright.”\n\nHe stared blankly at him. “Yeah. I think so too. I think I can make something better for myself.”\n\nHoward gave his wicked smile one last time, and turned to face his future. It was also time for Michael to face his. He wanted answers, and he was not willing to wait for them.\n\nSince the doors to the original containment cell were never replaced, Michael swiped his keycard, and the doors swung upon to reveal the cavernous surroundings of the director’s abode.\n\nIt looked incredibly vast for its size, and Michael felt like its deep, dark maw was going to swallow him whole. There were large stalactites and stalagmites everywhere, and tiny, almost unnoticeable veins of what looked like glowing minerals were scattered amongst the walls of this space. It looked like a geologist’s dream. Michael never asked the director why this space looked the way it was. Maybe he should ask her while he still had the time. If he would remember.\n\nThe director was sitting at her desk, typing away on her keyboard. Probably for some important business that he had no clearance for. He sat across from her, piquing her interest as he prepared his scripted remarks.\n\n“Afternoon, director.”\n\n“You as well, Michael. What brings you here?” she inquired.\n\n“There are two very important things that I need to discuss with you. First, the question of one Howard Bates. What exactly is the reason for his transferral?”\n\nThe director looked at him with hesitation. “Why do you want this information?”\n\n“Because, Madeline, I want him out. For good. He hurt me. He has to //get out//,” he snapped, a little harder than he should’ve. He immediately regretted it.\n\nMadeline was taken slightly aback by his utterance of her forename. She shuffled her position to look as professional and assertive as possible. “I want to know everything.”\n\nHe felt the sensation of his stomach sinking to the floor. “I don’t even need to tell you everything.” And he pulled out the recorder, and played its contents in their entirety.\n\nHe could see the director’s expression immediately turn to worry. Not out of guilt or complicity, but genuine worry for what was said.\n\nA few moments after the recording sputtered out, she finally spoke. “How long has this been happening?”\n\n“It’s been happening to me for a while. Mr. Bates here, regardless of intentions or not, has verbally attacked me for the past few months. He knew I had a disability, and he exploited that to try and get me on his side. I do not think that he is in a reasonable capacity to continue working for this organization, if he’s acting like this.”\n\nMadeline looked sullen. “I didn’t know.”\n\nHe thought that excuse was pitiful. “You’re the director. You’re supposed to know everything. And I don’t ever see you leave your office.”\n\n“It’s because I have—”\n\n“Xeroderma pigmentosum, right. But doesn’t that only work on sunlight?” Michael was not having it.\n\nShe sighed. “It’s not in my purview to tell you my circumstances. But I didn’t know. And I should’ve taken more steps to avert the situation before it was exacerbated.”\n\nHis anger lessened slightly. “I understand. It probably just slipped right under your notice. But why is he being transferred? Who is transferring him?”\n\n“The O5s,” Madeline stated bluntly.\n\nHe blinked. “The Council?”\n\n“They thought he should’ve been in a place where his expertise was better suited.”\n\n“Can’t you just fire him? Or tell them that he needs to go?”\n\n“I can’t fire him. The Council says who gets to leave and who doesn’t. And I don’t think they’re the type to let essential personnel go.”\n\nHe was fuming, now. “So you’re just going to sit there, and let him go to the one place where no one is treated right? The //one place// that does not care for accountability?”\n\n“There’s nothing I can do. They won’t let me do anything past this point. I’m sorry.”\n\nHe slammed a fist on the table. “I should’ve sent that email earlier. I let this man do his thing for god knows how long, and now he’s walking away scot-free. This was all on me.”\n\nMadeline raised an eyebrow. “What email?”\n\n“…The email I sent you earlier today?”\n\n“Hold on.” She clicked on her keyboard a few times, and stared at the screen for a bit. “I didn’t get an email today.”\n\nMichael’s eyes opened wide, and he stared at a thousand-yards into the void, far beyond the director. “I didn’t send it.”\n\nHis hands started to shake. He trembled as he tried to say anything that he could, but nothing would come out.\n\nThe director’s concern for him was at an all time high. “Are you alright?”\n\nThere was no path he could go to but forwards. “I’m going to tell you the truth. I’m not just here because of Howard. I’m here to resign from the Foundation, and go back home.”\n\nShe didn’t know how to respond to that. His words were left hanging, and Michael could only hear the ambient sounds of the cavern around them.\n\nEventually, Madeline composed herself. “What is your reasoning behind this decision?”\n\n“I am the reason. Always have been, always will be. I believe that my current mental state has undercut my capability to continue my work here as a therapist. If I let this continue, my clients will not see a person that they can trust. They will see a constant failure, who lets everyone down at every turn.”\n\nShe looked bewildered. “I don’t think that’s the case at all. You were hand-picked to be the head of P&P for a reason. I do not believe that your diagnosed disorders make you a failure.”\n\n“Then you haven’t even begun to scratch the surface. Everything I do always never goes in my favor. No one thinks of me as anything more but a non-entity. And for //good reason//. I forget almost every little thing, every day, even something as stupid as my wallet or my phone. I don’t talk to anyone unless I’m required to do so. I get defensive every time I get confronted with anything, and defensive for things that I didn’t do at all. I’m too afraid of my own emotions, and I can’t even handle the slightest amount of criticism against me. I’m too emotional for this. I need to leave, for everyone’s sake.”\n\nHe never thought it would happen, but he felt the tears flow down his cheek. And he did it in front of the director. How pathetic was—\n\n“Your disability is not a moral failing. It is a disability that you have to live with. It will never go away, but you can be supported by being around people who care about you. And I know for a fact that there is at least one person in this facility who cares about you,” Madeline asserted, with no doubt in her voice.\n\nHe wiped the tears from his eyes. “She doesn’t deserve me.”\n\n“//You// deserve more than you think. You deserve to be happy.”\n\n“How can I be happy? I’ve been mocked and rejected all my life. The world does not want me. It could care less. I’ve tried, believe me, but I can’t. Why should I even bother, if no one wants to bother with me?”\n\nMadeline clasped her hands together. It looked eerily close to how he did it. “Self-care is not self-indulgence. Self-care is self-preservation, in a world that’s cold and cruel. It is defiance against the systems that hate, and who will gladly bend and break those trapped within the margins. Would you rather let yourself be whipped by the hands of the prejudiced, or allow yourself to continue building towards a brighter future?”\n\nMichael shuffled in his seat. “What kind of future would I bring? I won’t ever get to see a world where everything isn’t on fire.”\n\n“We all won’t. But I’d rather work towards a future where generations of kids won’t have to live in fear for being themselves, then do nothing at all. We might not live to see the sun on the horizon, but we can still //live//. We all live despite everything. You’re still here, despite everything. The world won’t give us what we want. But it’s up to us to find happiness in spite of that, in the people we love and care for.”\n\nHe considered it. Michael understood what she meant. But the fear and anxiety were still there.\n\n“I don’t even think my job is worth it in the first place. I can’t just lie to these people and try to make them happy in a place like this. Could you imagine having to live like this?”\n\nMadeline paused, and seemed to consider something. It looked like she was reminiscing on some past event, or events. “I can imagine that. I’ve been on that side before. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6461 I’ve been in this place since the beginning].”\n\nHe had no clue what that meant, but he decided to continue. “I don’t know why you even hired me. You knew I would object to being a part of this, and you still convinced me anyway.”\n\n“I told you their motto, and our motto. I told you the doctrines, and I also told you to ignore them. Because this is not about the Foundation, or its mission. This is about treating people as people. Even if we can only do so much, it still matters.”\n\nHe stopped making eye contact, and looked down at the desk. “I don’t know what to do. I’m not ready to go back to my duties. I don’t know how to fix this.”\n\nShe smiled sympathetically at him. “I’ll give you some time off. Mei will take over until you are ready. I want you to know that people do care. I care. I care very deeply about you.”\n\n“Do they care, though? I don’t see it. I can’t see it.”\n\n“Then maybe you need to expand your horizons. I’ll prove it to you. I’ll prove that you are valued and appreciated for who you are.”\n\nMichael smiled ruefully, but it was a genuine smile for the first time in what felt like forever. “You’re playing my own tricks on me, aren’t you?”\n\n“What can I say? I learned it from the best.” Madeline smiled back.\n\n“I’m really sorry about my outburst. I let my emotions get in my head,” Michael confessed.\n\n“No need to worry. It was completely justified. I have things on my end that I need to work on as well. You’re going to get better. I know you will.”\n\nMichael’s ever-present anxieties were somewhat quelled for the moment. He was still conflicted, and didn’t know what tomorrow would bring. It terrified him, but he needed things to change. He needed to get better. He needed to be better for himself. For his friend. For the people he cared about, and for the --anomalies-- people under his watch.\n\nAnd he knew one person who would be eager to help him out with that.\n\n----\n\nWhen he had the time to do so, he went through the personnel dormitory wing, going past each door until he reached the room he wanted. He raised a fist, and hesitated for a few seconds, before knocking on the door three times.\n\nHe heard several clanging sounds and curses before the door opened, revealing Emily in her pajamas, her hair disheveled.\n\n“Bad morning?” Michael guessed.\n\n“I overslept.” She sighed. “I’ll get dressed in a bit.”\n\nHe nodded, and she closed the door. Minutes felt like hours, and he wondered what his future would be like, now that the curtains have unfurled and the whole world opened up for him to explore. He wanted to use his vacation time to walk around the city that he called home, try new foods, and just walk around and feel the cool air on his skin. It was certainly better than these hollow walls.\n\nEventually, Emily opened up the door and gestured for him to come in. Her belongings were, of course, scattered all over the place with no rhyme or reason. The bed wasn’t even made yet. It was messy, but he liked it that way. It gave the room a sort of comfort, knowing that these objects were well-worn with care.\n\nThey both sat on the couch. Michael started first, which he usually never did. “I think I know my worth now.”\n\n“You figured it out.”\n\n“I did. I was blinded by my own preconceptions about myself. I couldn’t get over that wall I built,” Michael clarified.\n\n“I’m just glad you’re alright. I was worried about you.”\n\n“You were?”\n\nShe squeezed his shoulder lightly. “Yes! Why wouldn’t I?”\n\nHe raised his hands in the air. “I’m just trolling. I know you care.”\n\nEmily snorted. “Trolling? Are you speaking Gen-Z now?”\n\n“Would you rather I have nursing home language in my vernacular?” Michael asked in jest.\n\nShe laughed with a soft, melodic tone. “I don’t think you’re //that// old.”\n\n“Of course not, and that’s a good thing. I still have time to figure things out.” He paused. “I don’t know what my future holds. I know I’ll still screw things up, that’s a given. But I think it’ll be better, because I have someone on my side to remind me that it’s not all bad. I may not say what I mean sometimes, and my feelings might get the better of me, but at least I have someone to catch me when I fall.”\n\nAnd he could not fall if he did not dare to fly. But he took that leap of faith, and he was fine. Regardless of how clipped his wings were, he could still fly. It didn’t matter how fast. Because he lived by his own terms, and not anyone else’s. He accepted no definitions but his own.\n\nEmily looked proud. Proud to be his friend, and proud of him for how far he’s come.\n\nMichael continued. “I want to talk about something else. This stuff’s been on my mind too much lately. I need to distract myself. I need to speak my mind on something else. Anything.”\n\n“Fine by me. Anything you want.”\n\nHe paused to think about it for a moment, but couldn’t come up with a topic to switch focus to. So instead, he asked her a question. “Is there anything that you’re confused about regarding my… identity?”\n\n“What, like your orientation? Eh…” she cringed. “I don’t want to say something that’ll make you uncomfortable.”\n\n“I think it’s okay to be wrong. It’s better to ask questions, no matter how ridiculous, than accidentally offend someone else because you were afraid to ask those questions.”\n\n“Right.” Emily put her head in her palm, and stared into space for a rather long time. “You know what, screw it. Can you tell me about, what are those called, QPRs?”\n\n“Of course! I would love that.” He was eager to elaborate on a topic that he personally enjoyed.\n\n“So Queerplatonic Relationships, or QPRs for short, are like if someone wanted a relationship with someone else but without all the sexual and romantic bits. It’s a flexible idea, and the details of what that relationship would be like depend on the person. It’s not a rigid framework that just goes ‘oh they’re dating but not really.’ I personally think that these kinds of relationships can be as deep or even deeper than the romantic types. Or they don’t have to be. Again, it all depends on what the people in the QPRs want.”\n\nEmily listened to him intently, following along to what he was saying. “Ok, so it’s not just romance 2.0.”\n\n“People might frame it that way. They think we’re just recycling amatonormative ideas but in a new package. And we’re not. The existence of these kinds of relationships directly challenge the norms and beliefs that the mainstream public tries to impose onto us. It’s not just a substitute for romance. It’s a series of alternate routes and incommensurable geographies.”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. “Amatonormative?”\n\nHe lightly slapped himself in the forehead and expressed a look of surprise in a sarcastic manner. “Ah! Forgot to explain that term as well. It’s like heteronormativity, but with the idea that romantic relationships are the best way to live a fulfilling life.”\n\n“Oh, okay. That makes sense, actually. Thanks.”\n\nHe gave a thumbs up. “Always my pleasure to clear things up.”\n\nHe yammered on and on about his topics of interest, ones that he considered to be special and important to him. Emily listened and focused attentively for everything said, and provided questions to concepts that she was confused on. Michael could see that sparkle in her eye. She was genuinely interested in the things that brought joy to his life.\n\n“So yeah, I think a bunch of things don’t have to be romantic. Like cuddling. Why can’t I cuddle with my friends? What’s wrong with that? Or sleeping in the same bed. I can’t even say that I slept with someone without making it sound weird. ‘Slept next to someone in the same bed’ just sounds too overwrought.”\n\n“Would you want to do these things? Or be in a QPR?” Emily asked.\n\nMichael knew why she was asking that. “I don’t know. I just don’t think I’m ready for that. I’m already sick of all the lovey-dovey shit everywhere I go. And it’s not anyone’s fault. But, maybe I would like a bit of physical contact. I don’t know.”\n\n“It’s fine if you aren’t, just asking.” Emily then stopped, and looked as though she was trying to recall something from the inner recesses of her mind, before snapping back to reality. “I just remembered. I’ve got some things that the director sent to me. She said to bring it to you when you come over.”\n\nShe got up, and went to her closet to rummage around her hodgepodge of assorted items, before lumbering back with a few handwritten letters.\n\n“These are for me?” Michael asked.\n\n“Yep! I think you’ll like them.” She handed the letters out to Michael, who read them thoroughly one-by-one.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nSalutations my good fellow,\n\nI hope you’re feeling well in these difficult times.

It never comes out like I want it to. I guess I’m just not clever enough.\n\nBut I do want to say one thing. Thank you for caring for me. I know you’re trying. This place still sucks, but it could suck even worse. And that’s thanks to you, and the rest of the staff. I’m very glad I’m not at 17 anymore. So thank you.\n\n-Avery\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nMichael,\n@@ @@\nWe’ve never engaged in much conversation together. But your presence is still known, and welcomed.\n@@ @@\nTime waits for no one. We both know this. But you don’t have to follow its path. You must always follow what you desire. Change can be difficult, but invigorating once you understand where it leads you. You can take all the time you need to carve a future where you can live your life to the fullest. And that future is defined by you. Only you know who you are. Revel in the knowledge.\n@@ @@\nThe Chairs are proud. We are all proud of you, and what you’ve accomplished. I for one cannot wait for what you can achieve in the future.\n@@ @@\nDr. Mehrab Torabi\nChair of Temporal Studies\n[[/div]]\n\nHe couldn’t believe what he was reading. He was wrong. Regardless of how many times he talked to these people, his mere presence was enough to make himself known, and thought of. It should’ve been obvious. He was the Chair of P&P. But it never dawned on him until now. He was never a nobody.\n\nAll the emotion he suppressed broke free from the floodgates and poured through his soul. His eyes stung from the tears, his vision blurry, and his throat felt dry. But it wasn’t suffocating. It felt liberating.\n\n“I- wow.” He sniffled. “I didn’t- I should’ve known.”\n\n“But you know now. And I’m here to help if you need me.”\n\n“I know,” Michael said. He contemplated something, and then immediately shot out of his seat. “I also want to show you something. It’s a very personal possession of mine.”\n\nHe took her hand, and sped off to his dormitory. She could barely keep up with how fast he was going. He swung the door open, and led her to his couch.\n\n“Alright, just wait here.” He pointed at the couch, before opening the closet door and shutting it behind him.\n\nMichael’s room looked much more tidy and clean than his companion’s. He preferred to see where all his belongings were, and not lose track of anything. It made more logical sense to him, especially considering the everpresent fog in his brain.\n\nThis arrangement worked well for him, because he was himself. Regardless of how much he disdained some parts of his internal system, they made him into who he was. He was his own person, not a caricature, a human being. And that was better than anything he could ask for. He was himself, and he always will be.\n\nEventually, Michael came back out, with an acoustic guitar in hand.\n\n“My mother gave this to me. It was hers before… you know. I’ve never touched it until now.”\n\n“You want to play a song for me?”\n\n“Yes. I want to play her favorite song. And one of mine, but it was her song.” He sat down next to Emily, and placed his fingers in the correct positions.\n\nHe always practiced it, but never played it in front of anyone, for a number of reasons. He thought his singing wasn’t quite as good as it could be, and he never had anyone to perform for. But now he did. He had someone who cheered for him on the sidelines, who would always be there for him, no matter what obstacles he would face next.\n\nHe thought about himself, how the identities that defined him intersected with each other, and how they differed. He thought about the systems that hurt him, and how they could be challenged, and maybe even replaced one day. He thought about the people in his site, and how the variety of their experiences make the world a better place to live in.\n\nIt might have been easier if everything was black-and-white. But the world was so much more beautiful with all its shades of colors.\n\nHe remembered the beginning chords, and played the song like how he practiced. Like how his mother would play it.\n\nG, Am7, G/B, C, D…\n\nAnd there he was, the little blackbird, flying free.\n\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
