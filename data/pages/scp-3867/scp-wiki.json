Artificial Intelligence Construct TSAT has been programmed to monitor the [[[the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6|Dark Web]]] for any information relating to SCP-3867 or its creator(s).\n\n**Description:** SCP-3867 is an anomalous website under the domain 'www.scpd.♡♡♡', named 'Sweet Cats & Perfect Dogs!'.\n\nWhen visited, SCP-3867 will load a unique page displaying an image of its visitor's pet and describing the most recent actions taken by the subject of the image[[footnote]] Following extensive testing involving the surveillance of testing personnel's pets, the described actions were found to be accurate when not describing esoteric actions.[[/footnote]]. When visited by a subject without a dog or cat, SCP-3867 will instead display an image and the most recent actions taken by an animal available for adoption at the nearest animal shelter. Subjects will then be prompted to adopt the animal in question in order to 'experience these cute moments firsthand'.\n\n\n**SCP-3867 Testing Log** \n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**Subject:** Researcher Jade\n**Result:**\n-----\n[[=]]\n**Sweet Cats & Perfect Dogs!**\n@@ @@\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-right: 5px;\"]]\n[[image frankie.png style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n\n\n[[size 75%]]**Be vewwy vewwy quiet!**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-right: 5px;\"]]\nFranklin just snored a little bit but didn't wake up.
