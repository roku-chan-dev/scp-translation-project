Each of these realms can contain subdomains that inherit traits of their Realm; a notable example is the pocket universe containing the city of [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]].##\n\n##9E9E9E|SCP-6125-α are commonly known as Ways. SCP-6125-α are naturally occurring spatial distortions, allowing long-distance travel between realms and subdomains via the transfer of reality. Whilst travel between subdomains and realms have no visual difference, SCP-6125-α instances accessing other Realms have been found to leave trace tachyons on any matter passing through.  A list detailing all known SCP-6125-α instances can be acquired from RAISA.##\n\nSCP-6125-Ω designates 7 metal pillars arranged in a circle, 25 meters in diameter, located below the uninhabited island of Milneland, eastern Greenland. SCP-6125-Ω is primarily composed of magnetite, along with trace amounts of organic material. Each of these pillars is inscribed with inscriptions resembling ancient Daevite texts, theorized to be a precursor language. Each of these pillars has been shown to be an artificially constructed Way, leading to one of the known seven Realms.\n\nBelow, case studies have been compiled for each Realm.

Currently, no sapient life has been discovered by MTF exploration teams, though numerous insect species not native to the base realm have been discovered.\n\nBased on the inhabitants of Hyrials known subdomains, the consensus from the Occult Studies department is that Hyrials main realm was home to a species of reality-bending humanoids wiped out by an XK-class event. Due to the lack of developed infrastructure found, it is likely that said humanoids were equivalent to 1200 BC technology; though due to the potential abundance of reality-bending individuals, it is unknown if any later technology was merely wiped out of the realm.\n\n##9E9E9E|Owing to the potential threat posed by reality-altering beings located in this realm's subdomains, all exploration to them is prohibited.##\n\n##9E9E9E|**Researcher Notes:** Due to the abnormally high levels of reality present within this realm, it can be theorized that Hyrial had been altered by a higher being in the past. Currently, an investigation into [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2264|SCP-2264-5]]] is being carried out.

Researchers with level 5 clearance may contact RAISA to facilitate a connection to O5-13 when necessary.\n\n##9E9E9E|**Researcher Notes:** Dreas is built solely upon the dreams of sapient beings. Due to the constantly shifting nature of said subject matter, this realm appears rather unstable. However, due to the presence of the Oneiroi and the shared dream contents of certain individuals, Dreas is far more stable than perceived.##\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Additional Information__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oneiroi|Access Oneiroi root files]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Fourth Realm\" hide=\"—\"]]\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"cell-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"s-cell\"]]\n**Realm:**  Base Reality\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"s-cell\" style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n**Average Hume Level:** 79ξ\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n++++ **__Subdomains__**\n----\n◈ Free Ports ◈\n◈ Wanderers Library ◈\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Description__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n##9E9E9E|The Base Realm is the most well documented, as well as being the home of the majority of humanity.##\n\n##9E9E9E|Due to the high population of intelligent life in this realm there are a significant number of both natural and entity-built subdomains, many already documented by the Foundation.##\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Additional Information__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/locations-of-interest|Access Nexus database root file]]]\n[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wanderers-library-hub|Access WanderersLibrary database root file]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Fifth Realm\" hide=\"—\"]]\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"cell-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"s-cell\"]]\n**Realm:**  Adlivun\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"s-cell\" style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n**Average Hume Level:** 52ξ\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n++++ **__Subdomains__**\n----\n◈ Corbenic ◈\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: left\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Description__**\n[[/=]]\n----\nAdlivun is a pine forest shrouded in dense fog. Whilst entry to Adlivun is possible, all external matter brought into the realm decays at an exponential rate. Only a circle 12km around the entrance is currently mapped, whilst the rate of decay is significant at this point, a river surrounding the 12km area is the main issue prohibiting exploration. All agents who tried crossing the river were lost in the fog and communication was lost.\n\n##9E9E9E|Due to its nature, communication with Adlivun's sole known subdomain, Corbenic, is tenuous. Currently, 3 Foundation personnel are in contact with the Foundation from within Corbenic.##\n\n##9E9E9E|Extrapolating from Corbenic, Adlivun is assumed to be a realm housing multiple afterlives.

Giant black spires, writhing masses and warped shapes can be seen in the distance. These entities have been seen to shift and disappear at points, seemingly at random.\n\nThe Great Wastes is prone to extreme reality fluctuations. This causes tears in reality to open up often, destroying swathes of the ground matter. It is unknown where these reality tears lead, as no lost personnel have returned.\n\nAnalysis with agent's GADs[[footnote]]General Analysis Device[[/footnote]] shows an extremely high level of Akiva radiation, especially near any of the black growths.\n\n**Research Notes:** Despite no visible danger, all agents reported feeling short of breath and under extreme pressure whilst exploring the Great Wastes.

Numerous large, partially-preserved, creatures and skeletons are scattered across the realm, as well as a few primitive mechanical constructs, many with blunt force impacts. Many of the entities are quadrupedal, though a large proportion of those possess extra limbs or appendages, likely used for combat.\n\nAside from flares brought by exploring MTF/STF agents, the main source of lighting within Tumulus is multiple [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5005|gigantified versions of the anglerfish]]]. It is unknown what keeps the lights active, despite their host being long dead.\n\nThe hume level in specific areas is relatively stable, though fluctuates over large distances. This is likely due to large area reality-bending. In addition, certain areas within Tumulus have special characteristics, such as the slow down of time as well as lower gravity.\n\n**Research Notes:** One side of the battle seemed to have sustained far larger damage than the other. Due to the activity in the Great Wastes, it can be assumed entities residing in the higher realms had greater firepower, thus surviving. This suggests that there was a potential uprising against the higher planes, though the reason for this is unknown. A reason put forward by Dr Stevens is that it may be due to the noted increase in hume levels for higher realms, though further research to prove this hypothesis is needed.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Seventh Realm\" hide=\"—\"]]\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"cell-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"s-cell\"]]\n**Realm:**  Icarusium\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"s-cell\" style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n**Average Hume Level:** 21ξ\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n++++ **__Subdomains__**\n----\n◇ Unknown ◇\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: left\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Description__**\n----\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+++++ [Research into Icarusium is currently ongoing.]\n\nAs of 21/4/2037, STF Rho-7 (\"Greeting Party\") have entered SCP-6125-Ω.

The hume level in these new realities has been shown to exhibit extreme levels of fluxuation. Coupled with the discoveries from both the Great Wastes and Tumulus, it is highly likely that these three realms are remnants from a previous Hytoth.\n\nFurther investigation into the runes on the pillars of SCP-6125-Ω by the Occult Studies Department have shown that they are potentially preventing the formation of Ways to the previously unknown three realms.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Addendum Two__**\n[[/=]]\n----\nThree days after the entry of STF Rho-7 several transmissions were received and have been attached below:\n\n[[div class=\"minibox\"]]\nSir, Jameson's down again.
