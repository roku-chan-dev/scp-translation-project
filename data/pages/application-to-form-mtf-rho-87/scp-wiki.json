MC&D, Wondertainment, The Factory, etc. All of these GoIs have produced edible anomalies of some kind, but in generally small and exclusive amounts. As most competent Foundation employees and assets are aware, the consumption of anomalies is unwise. The issue is that most people in the world are //not// Foundation employees - a fact I am concerned many members of Foundation command have forgotten.\n\nWe are now aware of a small GoI operating somewhere in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, with a particular spotlight on Seattle, Boise, and multiple small towns throughout the region. This GoI has so far only produced a single SCP - [[[SCP-2867|SCP-2867]]], a strain of anomalous cheese that currently constitutes a Class III memetic hazard, a Class V security breach, and a Class VII biohazard - it is self-replicating, compulsive, infectious, and available and promoted for public consumption. It has appeared in cheese shops, supermarkets, and delicatessens throughout the region, appearing as various recognised and unrecognised brands of gorgonzola, mozzarella, and most recently, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses. They are chemically and visually indistinguishable from normal cheese, and containment has been left to individual tracking and destruction of infected individuals. \n\nThis is an //exceptionally// expensive, overt, and time-consuming process, that has so far been relegated to Foundation assets embedded within regional emergency services as well as the occasional direct-force MTF deployment. The costs of constantly deploying, withdrawing, re-deploying, and covering-up said deployments are astronomical, as well as resulting in drastically inefficient containment. As with any production-based skip, the final goal is to locate, disable, and contain the method of production and those responsible.\n\nEnter Jack Terrence and Terrence Farms, the former being an unknown PoI and the latter being the assumed producer of SCP-2867. From physical evidence and witness statements, we have determined Jack Terrence to be the original creator of SCP-2867 and Terrence Farms to be their business. Jack Terrence's identity, location, and motive are all unknown, and we know just as little information about Terrence Farms they do about us. \n\nA small statistic you won't find in the listed file: SCP-2867 has killed over 220 people, including one agent, two Foundation assets in the Seattle PD, and my former colleague, Dr. Pradesh. We have destroyed over two tons of captured product; about 1/10 of the amount we believe has been produced so far. We've spent upwards of thirty-three million dollars on containment; amnestics and situational blanketing alone have set us back five million. SCP-2867 is a Keter-class SCP; and it deserves such treatment. The response it has been allotted as of yet has been noting short of irresponsible and ignorant.\n\nMy request is simple. With command of  a small and decently-funded Mobile Task Force, we could most likely neutralise the threat before it gains significant national or international spread. My proposal would require very little; our entire requisitions form can be found on the next page.\n\nI hope you take my request into consideration.\n\nWith regards,\n\nDr. Ahmed Faisal, Site-19\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Application to form MTF Rho-87]]\n**Request to form a provisionary MTF**\n\n**Designation:** Mobile Task Force Rho-87 (\"All Chewed Up\")\n\n**Classification:** --(check one)-- Provisionary Regional Task Force\n\n|| [**X**] M (Combat) || [**X**] C (Containment) || [ ] G (Engineering) ||\n|| [ ] E (Esoteric) || [**X**] T (Tracking) || [ ] U (Undercover) ||\n\n**Mission Statement:**\n\n> Provisionary Regional Mobile Task Force Rho-87 (\"All Chewed Up\") will monitor cases of unexplained disappearances and other phenomena relating to possible SCP-2867 infection. Operatives will conduct in operations to destroy sources of SCP-2867 and ultimately capture POI-17357 (Jack Terrence) and the GoI //Terrence Farms//.\n\n**Task Force Organisation:**\n\n**Operations**\n\n> A group of retired agents and operatives from multiple arms of the Foundation. Ops will be responsible for boots-on-the-ground intelligence gathering, neutralisation, and investigation. Ops will be armed with civilian and military-grade munitions, and will be responsible for the purchase of most of their own equipment through back-channel sources. Operations personnel will be participating in live combat and operations that are uncleared by local law enforcement, with minimal intervention from existing Foundation assets //beyond// what is determined completely necessary. A complete operations personnel list can be found on the personnel page of this dossier.\n\n**Research**\n\n> A selection of doctors specialising in memetics, biohazards, and food-based anomalies from multiple arms of the Foundation. Research will be responsible for all technological research and conceptual development. Due to the indeterminate goals of the research team - whether focus is placed on developing a chemical countermeasure, a 'cure', or reverse-engineering the process through which SCP-2867 is created - the purpose of the research time will be specifically determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Material Requisitions]]\n\n**Operations:**\n\n> //Requirements://\n> \n> 2x Operational SUV\n> 1x Albatross UAV\n> 2x standard infiltration/breaching kit\n> 4x standard infantry kit\n> 1x Class IV MIIU (**M**obile **I**nfantry **I**ncineration **U**nit)\n> 4x SCAR-L assault rifles\n> $150,000\n> Further requisition capacity at Task Force discretion\n\n**Research:**\n\n> //Requirements://\n> \n> Standard microbiology testing equipment\n> Mobile testing/containment apparatus\n> Standard memetics research equipment\n> 18 (eighteen) units Class-B amnestics\n> Class V disinfectants\n> Class V biohazard protections equipment\n> 1x warehouse in the city of Seattle, with space to accomodate a ten-man operation\n> $350,000\n> Further requisition capacity at Task Force discretion\n\n**Overall Operations:**\n\n> MTF Rho-87 will require assistance and cooperation from MTF Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\") in preventing local law enforcement from interfering with operations. \n\nOverall Estimated cost of outfitting: **$1,985,575**\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Personnel Requisition]]\n\nMTF Rho-87 requires, at most, ten individuals, each with __distinct skills__.
