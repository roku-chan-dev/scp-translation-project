Any individuals attempting to gain access to SCP-3186 are to be interviewed and administered amnestics as is appropriate for their level of exposure.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3186 is an area, referred to by locals as 'Roger's Hill', located on the outskirts of Tursley, Massachusetts. Prior to its development of anomalous properties, SCP-3186 was used by local teenagers as a location for romantic socialization.\n\nWhen an individual is within SCP-3186 and looks up at the night sky, they will perceive the stars as moving to spell out a sequence of messages. There are nine messages in total, and the stars will move through this sequence on a loop until the viewer leaves SCP-3186. Note that this phenomenon is purely visual in nature, and no actual alteration of the stars is taking place.\n\nAnalysis of SCP-3186 suggests the use of thaumaturgy was involved in its creation using techniques described in several occult texts known to currently be in circulation. \n\n**Addendum 3186-1 (Message Sequence):**\n\n> HI BECKY\n\n> ME + YOU FOREVER\n\n> WILL YOU GO TO THE PROM WITH ME?\n\n> COMPLETE MESSAGE\n\n> MESSAGE COMPLETE\n\n> CANCEL\n\n> CANCEL MESSAGE\n\n> PLEASE CANCEL MESSAGE\n\n> FUCK\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3185]]] | SCP-3186 | [[[SCP-3187]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
