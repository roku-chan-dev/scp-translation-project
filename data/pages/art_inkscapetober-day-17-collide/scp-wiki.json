And it's really brandishing more than actually using. Nonetheless that inspired me to make this coat of arms. We see the ban hammer in action, striking a troll. In the background we see a fine pair of hammers worthy of banning with. And the motto could just as well have been a DrKens quote. To recognize the fact that DrKens also has an interest in engineering, I placed the symbol of a transistor in the upper left corner.\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** Another somewhat difficult prompt. A collision implies some form of motion, and that is hard to depict in a general coat of arms. So I decided to depict the exact moment of impact.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-16-compass| Day 16: Compass]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-18-moon| Day 18: Moon]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** DrKens.png\n> **Name:** DrKens\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nDrKens.png is a composite.
