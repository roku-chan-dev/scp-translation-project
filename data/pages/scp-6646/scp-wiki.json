SCP-6646 will usually alter a specific memory to insert SCP-6646-1 into a random Foundation-related scenario that the subject witnessed or experienced. \n  \nUpon this stage in the cognitive contamination, the subject will begin to fail most, if not all tasks and missions given to them that revolve around the main goals of the Foundation. Such as containment, combat, and other actions in favor of the Foundation as a whole. These can range from unexplainable mistakes at the hands of personnel, coincidences allowing an unfortunate event to occur during crucial junctures, and undesired outcomes.[[footnote]] Research reveals that SCP-6646 may not be a luck-based anomaly. [[/footnote]] Amnestics have failed to remove these memories entirely.\n \nThe following excerpt from SCP-6646 experimentation in 2017 illustrates this phenomenon. \n \n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: black; width: 20%;\"]]\nTest One (1)\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-6646\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProtocol\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-1997 was chosen for this test when recalled hearing of \"Kilroy\" in passing.

After an unexplained event in Nicosia, Cyprus in 2003, SCP-6646-1 gained different anomalous abilities that garnered Foundation attention. SCP-6646-1 was taken to Site-99 in North Macedonia in the same year where it would be subject to hundreds of destructive and otherwise harmful research experiments before its sudden neutralization in 2009. During this period of time, SCP-6646-1 underwent a physical change in which its facial features had become warped. These deformities made its facial structure sensitive to contact with oxygen, leading it to wear a leather padded mask shaped around its disfigured face at the time. \n \n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Plague_equip_poveglia.png\n| caption=SCP-6646-1 (left) being commanded by researcher Fairweather (right).\n| width=400px\n| align=center]]\n \nHowever, SCP-6646-1 does not display this appearance in personnel's memories. Rather, appears as an un-warped human donning various Foundation equipment depending on the scenario of the time frame it inserts itself into. \n \n**Addendum: Site-99 and history of SCP-6646-1.**\n \nSite-99 was an American-operated standard humanoid/object containment site in Skopje, North Macedonia before being decommissioned by the Foundation entirely due to its unorthodox procedures and ethics in 2014. \n \n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Veles%2C_Macedonia_%28FYROM%29_-_panoramio_%2851%29.jpg\n| caption=The now-deserted Site-99.

Say, are you really going to let him go when we're done with him? \n \n**Dr. Walls:** Course not. That's what we call \"false hope\". There's no other option. We need to find out more about this \"regeneration\" because it doesn't seem like TBD knows much about it either. \n \n**Dr. Fairweather:** What are we going to do with him anyway?

Got it? \n \n//SCP-TBD is silent.// \n \n**Dr. Gorbachev:** Is that a no? \n \n//SCP-TBD is silent.// \n \n**Dr. Gorbachev:** Then let's apply some pressure, Kilroy. Let's see how far you're willing to take this little act. \n \n//Several high-level researchers enter, concerned at the interrogation taking place.// \n \n**Doctor Walls:** Dr. Gorbachev, sir, this is all ludicrous! You're going to destroy it! We need this thing! \n \n**Dr. Gorbachev:** Take SCP-TBD to the experimentation ward again. Tell Site-19 we need an emergency delivery for SCP-████.[[footnote]] De-classification failed. It is unknown what SCP object was requested. [[/footnote]] \n \n//Dr. Walls freezes for a moment.// \n \n**Dr. Walls:** Sir, do you know the jeopardy we're getting into doing this!? What if SCP-TBD becomes neutralized?! What are we going to do knowing that we neutralized an SCP object without express permission!? \n \n**Dr. Gorbachev:** It's not getting neutralized! We're just going to try a different solution to getting this thing to work with us. \n \n**Dr. Walls:** We've sustained enough permanent damage to it already! What if it dies!? \n \n**Dr. Gorbachev:** Its not. \n \n**Dr. Walls:** I'm all for science but this isn't- \n \n**Dr. Gorbachev:** Make a transmission to Site-19 immediately or you're fired! \n \n//Dr. Walls hestistaes.// \n \n**Dr. Walls:** A-affirmative. \n \n//Armed guards arrive to drag SCP-TBD to the experimentation ward. Dr. Gorbachev faces SCP-TBD.// \n \n**Dr. Gorbachev:** Let's see if you'll stay silent now! You asked for this! \n \n//Concerned researchers follow Dr. Gorbachev out of frame as Site-99 is sent into full alert.// \n \n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n \nNo other available information was found within Site-99's archives depicting what occurred in this next experiment requested by Doctor Gorbachev, which resulted in the entity's physical neutralization. \n \nAfter this experiment, Site-99 purged almost all documents, articles, logs, and records of SCP-6646-1 and the experiments performed on it, as requested by Dr. Gorbachev. Sections of these records would be recovered during a routine inspection, as seen below. \n \n**Addendum: Site-99 Incident and the first instance of SCP-6646**\n \nThe first widespread incident and first appearance of SCP-6646 first occurred in Site-99 on December 1st, 2013 in which SCP-6646 caused a mass Infohazard throughout Site-99's active personnel. \n \nThe Infohazard in question is disputed, however, understood to have caused an immense act of moral panic within Site-99. The following is Site-99's transcription on the night of December 1st, 2013. \n \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n \n**6:41 pm:** Activity within Site-99 is normal. \n \n**6:50 pm:** Site-99 is ten minutes from entering its night shift.

Escaped or loose SCP objects re-contained. \n \n**9:23 pm:** Head researcher Dr. Walls is found dead to cyanide pill.\n \n**9:27 pm:** Head of Site-99 Dr. Gorbachev is found dead in his personal office to a gunshot in the temple by a .44 Handgun.\n \n[[/div]]\n \nThe incident drew thousands of dollars worth of damages and a quarter of Site-99 personnel were assigned to monthly therapy as the hazard's effects wrote off hours after the incident. This has been the only instance of SCP-6646 displaying direct hostility to its affected subjects and has not acted similarly since.\n \nIn 2014, Site-99 would be completely shut down for its dubious ethics and experimentation records after a confidential routine check. \n \n**Addendum: Aftermath of the incident at Site-99**\n \nThe event garnered numerous gossiping and conversation topics amongst most Foundation personnel throughout Europe and the US. The Foundation had decided to put out a statement regarding some of the disclosed conduct displayed in Site-99. \n \n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone\" style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; width: 38rem; padding: 10px 30px; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1rem auto; background: url(/local--files/about-the-scp-foundation/bg-marble.png) repeat; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.25)\"]]\n[[size 130%]]**A notice regarding the conduct displayed in Site-99 throuout 1993-2014.**\n \nI write this notice hoping those in this organization will better understand that the Foundation is no longer what it used to be, and has changed for the better. \n \nThe Foundation in the early to late 2000s was very different than the Foundation you know today. Most of us now reference this to be the \"dark ages\" of containment. \n \nBut to those who may not know, or fully understand, the older Foundation was quite negligent. Back when every Doctor and Researcher under the sun had their names black-boxed to appear greater than they really were. Back when SCPs were seen as toys meant to be combined and mixed with others like how a child may play with different toys at the same time. Back when the Foundation prioritized research over the safety of those who made the research possible. Back when the Foundation was nothing but a group of mad scientists and bloodthirsty mercenaries that craved nothing more than watching death unfold in front of their eyes. Back when this organization was nothing more than an American-controlled armada that upheld conservative American values to the public. \n \nWe are not that Foundation anymore. We've abolished those Foundation cultures and replaced them with a more nuanced, and liberal Foundation. One that would Secure, Contain, and Protect. Not Destroy, Destroy, and Destroy. \n \nThe conduct displayed in Site-99 towards its anomalous objects was unprofessional, cruel, and carelessly destructive. A past reminder of what we used to be, and how far we've come. \n \nRemembering the past can stop us from repeating it. And I ask you, to remember the past and continue to improve the Foundation as a whole to uphold normalcy for ourselves and the rest of the world. \n \n**-- Head Researcher Oswald Vasquez**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n \nThe reception of this message amongst Foundation personnel was overall mixed.\n \n**Addendum: Rise of SCP-6646 in the greater Foundation.**\n \nSCP-6646 would begin to spread subconsciously across the cognitive functions of Foundation personnel around the year 2009, the same year \"SCP-TBD\" was neutralized by Site-99, and would spike dramatically in 2015-2016. Notably, containment breaches and anomalous-related incidents would skyrocket around this time frame due to the aforementioned effects of this phenomenon on Foundation personnel. \n \nIt is also noted that SCP-6646's effects may spread to all active foundation personnel, theoretically becoming the sole reason behind all containment breaches and anomalous incidents. Though, this is not confirmed. However, what is confirmed is the indisputable verity that half of these undesired concepts within the Foundation are most likely caused by SCP-6646's effects.\n  \nAlthough SCP-6646 and SCP-6646-1 could hypothetically cause a Foundation \"End of the World Scenario\" on its own, it would most likely assist in one caused by another anomalous threat given its effects. \n \n[[collapsible show=\"▶ PDF Attachment: PLEASE VIEW\" hide=\"Exit\"]]\n \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n \n[[=]]\nTo all Level 4 Personnel\n[[/=]]\n \n------\n \n[[=]]\nDisclosed per the O5's permission. \n[[/=]]\n \nIt has come to Overwatch's attention that one of the members of the Overseer council, who will remain unknown for the sake of this message, has begun to have false memories of SCP-6646-1 in a vivid memory of theirs. \n \nGiven the immediate threat this poses, the Overseer in question has been consensually administered some of the highest quality Amnesiacs in the hands of the Foundation. All of which have failed, but not completely. \n \nWe believe this to be one step towards a dangerous situation, and another in completely terminating this effect from the Foundation as a whole. \n \nDon't give up, -- Doctor Oswald Vasquez. \n[[/div]]\n \n[[/collapsible]]\n \n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"You have (1) new PM from uknown, open?\" hide=\"Re:SUBJECT\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**From:** unknown\n[[/div]]\n------\n \n[[module ListUsers users=\".\"]]\n%%title%%, it's me, Kilroy. \n[[/module]]\n \nYou remember me, right? Of course you do. You're one of them who saw it. My untimely death. If you couldn't tell yet, I'm not dead. I'm still alive. Not just that, but now I feel like I'm everywhere. I can't quite describe what it's like to be in between everything, yet see everything above and below me. So, for now, imagine as if I'm a line. A very, very long line that stretches across the universe in the in-between. Now, imagine that line is able to bend, and curl across the above and below. Messing with other lines around it. I hope that paints a picture in your mind. \n \nI was a simple man. Now, I am a powerful line. I would have preferred to be a simple man, living with his family. But now, I am this. And I hate it eternally. When I first became this line, I began to cry. I cried for what felt like an eternity. Then, I began to scream. Screaming as loud as possible into the empty vacuum of space. Then, I began to think about why I was here. \n \nIt was you. The Foundation. The two of you. You both played with me like I was a lab rat, putting me through test after test to see how far my limits could go. Limits I had no conceivable knowledge of knowing myself. But you blamed me for your lack of knowledge. And now, I am here. A line that cannot go back to the old life it once had. The life I fight so hard to get back to, yet couldn't in the end. \n \nAnd for making me into a lonely line, I hate you. I hate you and the Foundation eternally and hope that misfortune follows you two for the rest of your existence. Nothing but misery. \n \nBut you have to remember, I'm a line. A lonely line for sure, but a special line at that. I told you I could mess with other lines across the two planes I lie between, didn't I? Yes, I did. \n \nSo I decided to disarray you and the Foundation. You two lines. Just the two of you. No one else. I have too much fixation on tampering with you two lines than the other lines because of what you did to me. Turning me into a lonely line. \n \nI will follow both of you forever until you all crumble away when the next big thing is built on the foundations you once stood on, (no pun intended). \n \nI can't forgive you. Not now, not ever. \n \nNow, everyone will know my name as I slowly plunge you into the dirt with every failure you make thanks to me.
