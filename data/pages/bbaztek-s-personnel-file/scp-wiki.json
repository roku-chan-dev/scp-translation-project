  "content": "**About:** bbaztek takes his name from the unsung hero of the Breaking Bad television series, Walter White's Pontiac Aztek. In a universe with an inexplicable hatred for windshields, someone has to transport our --beloved-- maligned protagonist around. The Pontiac Aztek is the car for that job. \n\nWhen he's not busy shoehorning the city of Boston into his articles, bbaztek can be found beside a pile of empty Red Bull cans slaving over a hot sandbox. I guess he has no life.\n\n__SCPs__:\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"bbaztek\" separate=\"no\" limit=\"250\" perPage=\"250\" tags=\"scp, -joke\" order=\"title\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
