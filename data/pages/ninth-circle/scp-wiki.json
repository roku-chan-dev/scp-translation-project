There is a pale grey Foundation logo on her shoulder, but it's different from usual. She closes the door behind her, framing her body against the opening. Joseph wasn't able to look outside in time.\n\n\"Well, hello Joseph.\"\n\nHer voice is kind and rusty, the type that grinds at your ears with all the affection of the world. She smiles at Joseph, the type of smile that seems to go on for miles, fitted with uncanny plastic-looking teeth.\n\n\"I'm Doctor Johanna Adler. Now, before we start, do you know why you're here?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Joseph shrugged. \"I have no idea why you Foundation fucks brought me here.\"\n\n\"You really don't?\" She gingerly pulls out a little notebook from an inner pocket and starts writing with her pencil. \"Dearie, I can tell by these tattoos and those eyes of yours that you probably did something unsavoury to be here.\"\n\n\"Unsavor--?\" Joseph snorts in disgust. \"I didn't do anything wrong. White coat got what was coming to him.\"\n\nShe gazes back at Joseph with an exciting look. \"Hoh, so you killed someone?\"\n\nHe stares at the wall behind her. \"If I'd had ten more seconds, yeah.\"\n\nShe's still staring at Joseph, with that disturbing smile. \"So you attempted to kill someone, is that right?\"\n\nHe looks back. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Interesting.\" She said, dutifully jotting down notes in her little notepad.\n\nShe continues. \"So, as you probably guessed by now, I'm a Foundation researcher.\"\n\n\"//Really//? I would've never known.\" says Joseph sarcastically.\n\n\"But I'm from DAP; the Department of Atypical Persuasion.\"\n\nHe glowers at the researcher. \"What do you mean by Aty--\"\n\nHe's suddenly muzzled by the old woman, a mask made out of dark metal and tangled in a hundred wires. He tries to shake it off, to no avail.\n\nHe screams at the woman for putting the mask out of his face but fails to utter a single sound.\n\n\"We developed this little miracle. It will make you quiet.\" She places her index finger against her lips. \"It's not that I don't like you talking; I could just gab for hours! But silence makes my job much easier, you see?\"\n\nHe doesn't listen. Joseph tries to shake his head in every direction, yelling and spitting into it, but that damned muzzle doesn't budge. She turns from Joseph and searches through the white bag. \"At last! We can start.\"\n\nWith her back turned, searching, Joseph catches a better glimpse at the strange Foundation logo. It's the usual border of the logo, but an icon of a black brain in the center is penetrated by three arrows pointing down. Joseph has no idea what it could mean.\n\nFinally, she stand back up, groaning in pain. \"When you get to my age, everything is a chore.\" She reveals a black round remote with multiple buttons. \"Here we go.\"\n\nShe pushes a button. Joseph's head suddenly snaps back, his neck straining from the tension. He struggles to pull his head back down, as if the hair on his head was wrenched back.\n\n\"And that is just for making sure you won't twitch and giggle while I do my job.\"\n\nJoseph looks directly at the researcher in fear and confusion. His vision is blurred, the edge of his vision becomes streaks of colour as the woman's voice bleeds in his ears.\n\n\"My department was created in... I think sometime in the 50s? Our entire careers back then were to torture people to get information. It was... a constant and complex struggle. Nowadays, there are probably thousands of psychics, truth serums, or reality-bending, intelligence constructs used to read the mind of others.\"\n\nAs she speaks, she takes the folded chair, slowly bending it open, and places it directly in front of Joseph.\n\n\"But that doesn't mean we don't do that anymore. No matter how many mind-affecting anomalies there are, there will also be another anomaly to counter their effect. Such is the nature of anomalies. Always a bigger fish. Of course, we do things besides persuade people to spill the beans.\"\n\nThe chair makes a little squeaking sound as she sits in it, and she pulls out a little green jar. Joseph can barely make out her words. His nerves are hyper-focused on the pain in his neck, trying to figure out a way to get out of his invisible trap.\n\nShe continues. \"Sometimes, it's a question of containment, where we have to torture someone to keep an anomaly contained. Occasionally, we torture the anomalies themselves. Those are the worst kinds. There are times when an innocent must be hurt, entirely undeserving. My sympathies go out to them.\" She shakes her head, disappointed.\n\nShe looks up and flashes her toothy smile. \"And finally, I get to torture the people like you. Because you simply misbehave! And we can't have that.\"\n\nJoseph can read the words, //ANOMALOUS BIOHAZARD//, on the side of the jar. She opens the jar, revealing a purple substance resembling an ointment. The smell is putrid.\n\n\"That's why I love this job; you never know what comes your way, and that's kind of //exciting//, you know?\"\n\nShe spreads the weird cream on Joseph's arm. Carefully and slowly. She then takes out a tiny napkin and wipes the substance from her fingers. \"So we just wait a little bit to let it dry and...\" She waits a few seconds. \"Boop!\"\n\nShe touches the surface.\n\nJoseph's arm is torn off, as though a cannon ripped through him. He feels his bones cracking and twisting, the marrow and sinew exposed to frigid air. He is losing blood; he feels cold. He gasps for air. His vision fades away, and he dies of shock, only to wake up a moment later.\n\nShe removes her finger. \"It feels like real pain, doesn't it? Don't worry; the little doodad on your mouth will make sure you do can't pass out.\"\n\nHe looks at his arm. It's still there, intact. As if his arm was removed for a short time, only to grow back the second later. As if nothing happened.\n\n\"I know; it's pretty weird, but you'll get used to it. Let's try other parts of your body.\"\n\nShe scoops up a dollop of purple cream and begins to smear it on Joseph's forehead. He tries to move, but he is still glued to the chair. He tries to beg her to stop, but no words come out.\n\n\"Calm down a bit; it's only the beginning. Today is just a test, no //real// torture yet.\"\n\nShe accidentally nudges the covered surface of his forehead.\n\nA hundred blunt screwdriver chisels into his head, leaving his brain exposed to the air. He can feel his cranium drying up and crumbling as the vibration of the blow sends needles into the rest of his body. He dies, only to unceremoniously come back yet again.\n\n\"You're quite good at this. As a break, you can eat your dinner.\"\n\nShe searches in her bag and pulls out a long, transparent tube with a sloshing liquid pocket, holding a dirty brown texture. She slips the end of the tube into one of the holes in the mask adorning Joseph's face. She presses on the liquid pocket, and he can see the brown substance slowly worm its way through the tube. With each heavy, gasping wheeze, the thick sludge is pushed into his gullet, the thought of which makes him retch.\n\n\"There you go, enjoy it while it lasts. Everything I do makes this easier; I won't have to feed you for a long time.\"\n\n//'Enjoy it?'// His mind wanders further. //'Did I eat it? I didn't feel anything entering my mouth. It's entirely tasteless.'//\n\n\"That's it for today. Take a snooze, hun. We have a big day tomorrow.\"\n\nShe takes out the remote, pushes another button, and he immediately falls asleep.\n\n[[div style=\"border-top: solid 1px black; border-bottom: solid 1px black; margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; padding: 5px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe next day, Joseph wakes up in a cold sweat. The old woman peers over him, smiling that damned horrid smile, and lowers a pair of red eyewear onto him. Afterwards, she sat down beside him, tucking a napkin around her neck, and makes a long, thin slit in his stomach. He watches as his intestines spill out, imagining what it might feel like to try and push it all back into his gut. The old woman begins frothing at the mouth, her eyes bloodshot red, and she dives into his stomach, scarfing down his organs. She sucks the blood out of his pancreas, and pulls apart his kidneys like bread. At least, until she accidentally knocks off the glasses, revealing the same old lady, except she's reading a book. She then pressed a button on her remote, and he falls asleep.\n\nThe day after, Joseph wakes up, hearing the same, wooden footsteps, and the woman entered. This time, she holds a glass container where a giant parasitic worm writhed about. She places the container's end on his body, and a blazing fire subsumes his body. His flesh begins to melt as if burning hot magma was poured over his chest, the fat bubbling and leaking onto the chair. In a desperate plea, he leans over to drip blood, pus, and fat onto his cuffs, hoping to slip out. His blood begins pooling, a brilliant sanguine drying into a viscous, tar-like mess, sticky and black. He vomits into the mask, but is quickly wiped clean, removing any trace of puke. Once finished, she presses the button again, and he was ready for the next day.\n\nAnd it was like that for... Weeks? Months? Joseph couldn't tell anymore. His sleep was instantaneous and restless. His waking moments were spent on torture, without knowing if he had slept at all. It has been so long time since he ate a meal that he fondly recalls the brown sludge fed to him on the first day. He doesn't know what to do. He wants to beg for forgiveness, and a deliver a deep-seated promise to follow every test dutifully, with no questions asked. He'll even bark like a dog.\n\nThe muzzle stays on.\n\nHe doesn't know what the Foundation wants from him anymore. Why do they keep torturing him? His hair has grown long, gray, and unkempt. His body is entirely unmarred; any traces of wounding or scarring is wiped clean, as blank as a fresh canvas. But he clearly remembers every time //something// was used on him, each strange torture device.\n\nThe days go on and on. Always the same thing, hearing the steps from behind the door, the old woman torturing him while talking about her manicures, and the day finishes at the press of a button, his agency erased. The doctor became a bodiless voice and a smile to Joseph, witnessing his agony with a sign of empathy.\n\nBut, sometimes, it's different. Sometimes Joseph sees someone else entering the chamber. Sometimes he is welcomed by his father, friends, people he's intimate with, and they all try to torture him in every possible way. This brought some sort of cruel comfort to Joseph. He still remembers enough to keep him sane. Although, he's unsure if what he has seen is real; maybe he's lost his mind.\n\n//'When is it going to end?'// At first, this question cycles through Joseph's head. After what seemed like years, the question changed. //'Will it ever end?'//\n\n[[div style=\"border-top: solid 1px black; border-bottom: solid 1px black; margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; padding: 5px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe wakes up.\n\nLike every other day, he feels weak at the mercy of the old woman of the Foundation.\n\nHe tries to squint to look at the clock. Fatigue clouds his mind, even seeing causes sharp pains behind his eyeballs. He can barely make something out beyond the blurriness.\n\n[[div style=\"border-top: solid 1px black; border-bottom: solid 1px black; margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px; padding: 5px;\"]]\n= __6:42__\n[[/div]]\n\n//'Was it always 6:42?'// He thinks.\n@@ @@\n= [[size 50%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 60%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 70%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\nShe is coming.\n@@ @@\n= [[size 80%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 90%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 100%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\nJoseph doesn't have the energy to move.\n@@ @@\n= [[size 110%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 120%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 130%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\nHe just accepts it.\n@@ @@\n= [[size 140%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 150%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 160%]]//Tap//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\nThe handle turns, and the woman enters. Joseph doesn't even look at her until she closes the door behind her.\n\nBut it's not the woman this time. Joseph gawps at a monstrosity. A disgusting amalgamation of flesh and exposed organs, forming a rounded figure with an orifice in the center. Like a massive television made of meat.
