It is to be provided with several arcade cabinets acquired from the defunct Costa Mesa, California franchise location of the Pizza Palace restaurant chain. SCP-5583 is permitted to periodically exit its containment cell under armed guard when not undergoing testing, so long as a specialized sheathe is fitted over its horn. \n\n----\n\n**Description:** SCP-5583 is an animatronic figure[[footnote]]A mechanical puppet.[[/footnote]] associated with the American restaurant chain Pizza Palace. It measures 1.8 meters in height, and has the appearance of an anthropomorphic unicorn wearing a magenta wig and a pink tutu. A plastic purple star wand covered in glitter is attached to its left palm. Beyond dried grease and mucous stains on its legs, SCP-5583 is in a good state of repair.\n\nSCP-5583 is sapient, and capable of more advanced mobility than its mechanical components should allow. It is able to communicate via a speaker within its mouth using both masculine Scottish and feminine English accents, displaying a marked preference for the former.\n\nSCP-5583 also possesses the following minor anomalous attributes:\n\n* The ability to process food via a hatch in its mouth. Though SCP-5583 claims it is capable of digestion, internal analysis reveals no digestive system and no traces of previous meals are evident.\n\n* The production of clouds of luminescent glitter when the star on its wand strikes solid matter. Frame-by-frame video analysis reveals that the glitter peels off from the wand itself and immediately self-illuminates before disappearing and reappearing on the wand.\n\n* The manifestation of wings on its back at will. Said wings are organic, resembling those of //Danaus plexippus// (the monarch butterfly) at both structural and genetic levels. Due to SCP-5583's weight and the short span of its wings, it is incapable of flight.\n\n* The emission of beams of refracted light from the tip of its horn. SCP-5583 is capable of heating matter by concentrating these beams at a specific target, up to and including the point of combustion.\n\n* The tutu has so far proven indestructible, and cannot be removed.\n\n----\n\n**Discovery:** On 6/3/2019, SCP-5583 became known to the Foundation following an incident occurring at a Pizza Palace restaurant in Costa Mesa, California. A customer inadvertently provoked SCP-5583 as it was performing, resulting in it breaking character and causing a public disturbance before exiting the premises. The incident was reconstructed using footage from security cameras and cellphones recovered from the patrons.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Access Video Logs (06/03/2019)\" hide=\"- Close Video Logs (06/03/2019)\"]]\n\n> **[Camera 4: Skippy's Stage]**\n> \n> //Children are operating arcade cabinets and playing in the aisles.

SCP-5583 was found at a local train station and captured after some resistance. An investigation into Pizza Palace revealed that the animatronics at all other locations were non-anomalous, and no further paranormal activity has been reported since the containment of SCP-5583. \n\nThe cameras at the Costa Mesa location were installed by an employee acting on his own initiative. When interviewed, he outlined his suspicion that SCP-5583 was in fact alive, which he had expressed fruitlessly to his co-workers. With permission from the manager, he had purchased the cameras and placed them around the building's interior. Footage from the night before the incident showed SCP-5583 activating after the restaurant closed and interacting with many of the attractions. Only the stage cameras were capable of recording audio.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Access Video Logs (06/02/2019)\" hide=\"- Close Video Logs (06/02/2019)\"]]\n\n> **[Camera 1: Main Entrance]**\n> \n> //The final guests depart, and after one last check the employees follow, locking the doors behind them. SCP-5583's head emerges from the curtain across its stage. It looks left and right several times before drawing the curtain open.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 steps down from the stage, and stretches. It begins talking to itself. SCP-5583 makes its way to the prize counter. It lifts the flap, walks past the prize shelves and begins rummaging through a cardboard box labelled \"Lost and Found.\"//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 pulls out a red cowboy hat with a plastic yellow star pinned to the crown. It removes its tiara, tossing it dismissively onto the prize counter, then places the cowboy hat on its head and inspects itself in a nearby mirror. It nods approvingly, still talking to itself.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 turns to examine the prizes. It takes a toy gun holster off the shelf, and attaches it with some difficulty to its waist. It takes a wide stance facing the mirror, its free hand hovering over the gun.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 appears to threaten its own reflection for several seconds. It then pulls the gun from its holster and fires two suction darts. They strike the mirror, fail to stick, and fall to the floor.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 nods in satisfaction. It pretends to spit, and mimes blowing on the barrel of the gun. The gun discharges, and a third dart strikes SCP-5583's right eyeball and sticks there.//\n> \n> //In visible distress, SCP-5583 drops the gun and collides with the shelf, scattering prizes on the floor. It grabs the dart with both hands, and pulls. The dart, and the eyeball, are removed with an audible// pop.\n> \n> //SCP-5583 picks up the gun, places it on the counter, and strikes it repeatedly with its wand. Glitter obscures the camera view. When the image resolves, SCP-5583 has removed the dart from its eye and the hat from its head, has returned the eye to its socket, and is considering the tiara mournfully.//\n> \n> **[TRIMMED FOR BREVITY]**\n\n\n> **[Camera 8: Play Area]**\n> \n> //SCP-5583 is wiping down a playpen with a wet rag. It steps back and inspects its work.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 notices a helium balloon on the ceiling, and pantomimes exasperation. It begins talking to itself as it jumps up, reaching for the balloon with both hands. It misses twice before manifesting its wings and making a third attempt, which also fails. SCP-5583 makes a rude gesture at the balloon, then sniffs the air.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 approaches the ball pit, and looks down. It pantomimes distress; a veneer of what appears to be vomit can be seen on the balls.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 calls for help from off-camera, then waits for it to arrive. It does not.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 leaves the play area, returning five minutes later with a mop and a bucket of water. It sets the bucket down, wets the mop, and begins brushing the balls. It is still talking to itself, clearly becoming frustrated.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 throws the mop down with a clatter and leans over the edge of the pit, as if attempting to gauge its depth.//\n> \n> //SCP-5583 slips on a puddle of water from the fallen mop, tumbling face-first into the ball pit. It yelps, flailing helplessly for a few moments before sinking beneath the balls.//\n> \n> //Ten seconds later, SCP-5583's free hand emerges from the center of the pit. It swims to the edge and hauls itself out. It lies on the floor, panting heavily for eight seconds before noticing a large, spreading brown stain on its chest.//\n> \n> //Screaming, SCP-5583 frantically wipes at the stain with both of its hands, further soiling itself. It begins to shake, making gagging motions as it staggers to its feet and runs off-camera.//\n> \n> **[TRIMMED FOR BREVITY]**\n\n> **[Camera 7: Arcade]**\n> \n> //The camera is positioned over a row of [[[SCP-5963|arcade cabinets]]].

SCP-5583 watches the performance in silence for several minutes before touching each of the candles on the cake with its horn, lighting them.//\n> \n> **SCP-5583:** Happy birthday, fellas.\n> \n> //SCP-5583 blows out the candles and cuts a corner off the cake. The animatronics continue to sing as SCP-5583 mechanically masticates the entire cake, slice by slice, staring into space.//\n> \n> **[LOG ENDS]**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSCP-5583 periodically asks after the status of its fellow animatronics. Staff are to advise SCP-5583 that they were relocated to a more successful franchise location upstate.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5582]]] | SCP-5583 | [[[SCP-5584]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Nickthebrick1 and HarryBlank]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Skippy.jpg\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC 3.0\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
