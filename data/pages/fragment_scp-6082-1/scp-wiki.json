Access to SCP-6082 is solely granted to personnel with Level 4 Clearance and above.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6082-A is a massive subterranean complex located 200 meters below Yellowknife, NWT, Canada, solely accessible by the use of a hatch located under the Great Slave Lake.\n\nSCP-6082-A takes the form of a large, steel-made, pentagonal boiler room, comprised out of several mechanical devices, specifically designed as a power source for a compiled amount of activities. Analysis of the evidence found within SCP-6082-A points towards the anomaly being created using anomalous technology on the 11/27/1969 as a containment unit and power source for SCP-6082. The entity or group of interest employed in order to create SCP-6082-A and SCP-6082 is currently unknown.\n\nSCP-6082-A is completely automated and it requires no human intervention in order to operate, possessing the necessary paraphernalia in order to complete its tasks. Some additional objects and components can be found:\n\n* Large amounts of piping.\n* Cylindrical glass tubes, containing pistons which compress material energy sources such as charcoal, raw petroleum, and uranium chunks into one, single homogeneous mass, later pushed through a pair of pipes. Such products are leaked through long, thin steel pipes.\n* Two wider, longer pipes by which waste gases are leaked, presumed to end in an unknown pocket dimension.\n* A massive hatch located in the center of SCP-6082-A, used as an entrance to SCP-6082. At the edge of the hatch, a control booth can be found.\n* A set of recordings of nearby galaxies, presumed to be taken from an extraterrestrial location within the Sol System.\n* A large, golden placard reading [[[SCP-3790|\"Department of Abnormalities\"]]] located at the center of SCP-6082-A's hatch.[[footnote]]The placard was barely damaged upon arrival of MTF Zeta-9 to the location.[[/footnote]]\n* Several blueprints depicting a series of automated drones.\n\nSCP-6082-A's composition has led the SCP Foundation's Paratechnology Division to believe that it is a containment chamber for SCP-6082. SCP-6082-A is, otherwise, un-anomalous. \n\nSCP-6082 is a massive shaft located under SCP-6082-A. SCP-6082 is, as of the time of writing, currently inaccessible. Research into opening SCP-6082 is currently ongoing.\n\n----\n\n= **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6082/offset/1|UPDATE 18/09/1999: Head Researcher Lancaster, there is an addendum waiting to be uploaded to this file.
