To ensure that, just as the free market dictates, everyone can utilize 終-Y-1789 to their advantage, three variants of the product were created:\n* **Y01-α:** The standard model of the product, adapted to the global conditions of aboveground Earth;\n* **Y01-β:** The model of the product created for the extremely harsh environmental conditions of Druv'tuul, produced at the personal request of King Eldröl Gérunda;\n* **Y01-γ:** An experimental model created to withstand the conditions of the vacuum of space, produced for the developing [[[david-hunt-on-galileo|Lunar City of Galileo]]] project. Due to their specifications, Y01-γ model plants are much smaller than Y01-α and Y01-β; similarly, their crops also come in smaller yields.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/nexus-hyperline/aviatica.png width=\"200px\"]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-size: 450%; margin: 2px 0 5px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color: #f26c0c;\"]]\n= **AVIATICA**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-size: 120%; margin: 2px 0 5px; font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;\"]]\n= **With the Wings of Freedom Rings the Bell of Progress**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"color: #f08502; font-family: serif; font-size: 105%; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-weight: 900;\"]]\n= **01/02/2034 | ISSUE 18, VOLUME 19**\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-size: 92%; margin: 2px 0 5px; font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;\"]]\n[[size 400%]]**Let Them Eat Cake**[[/size]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[==]]\n[[size 120%]]**The latest survey of the Druv'tuul population indicates that support for King Eldröl Gérunda has dropped significantly in recent years. When he was elected as the city's king in 1965, his support among the population was as high as 89,3% -- but now, after a few decades of his rule, his support is only 23,4%. So what happened? Experts and sociologists dealing with the Druv'tuul geopolitical landscape unanimously point to one reason for the collapse of faith in the royal institution: the betrayal of the city in the name of the interests of foreign organizations.**\n@@ @@\n**Eldröl Gérunda's support did not fall overnight, however. As early as 2021, following the [[[hour-zero|collapse of the Veil]]] -- when documents were revealed indicating collaboration between Eldröl Gérunda and the SCP Foundation, a firm supporter of him becoming king -- the ruler's popularity plummeted, but this did not shake his position all that much.**\n@@ @@\n**It was only later that the turning point would come when, along with its opening to the wider world, the city experienced a series of pandemics and economic crises that lasted more than a decade. The king and his government truly failed to properly deal with the city's issues. Still, in spite of these faults, the Druv'tuul government clearly was still working in the interest of the people, though through questionable means.**\n@@ @@\n**It wasn't until 2033 that the king truly overdid it. Ignoring the will of his citizens, Gérunda opened the Druv'tuul market to multinational megacorporations such as MC&D, Oneiroi Incorporated, and JOICL -- which, as some experts say, were complicit in causing earlier crises. At the same time, the king invested in numerous new projects -- such as the \"Trees of Liberty,\" which were supposedly meant to revitalize the country's economy and save it from poverty. Just as they expressed earlier in protests in the streets, the city's residents are now unafraid to repeat their words: the people of Druv'tuul do not want Robert Carter's free-market ideology in their city. In recent months, the \"Trees of Liberty\" have been officially introduced to Druv'tuul, only leading to an even wider gap between Druv'tuul residents and the \"social elite\" forming. This \"social elite\" which now isn't just made up of the aristocracy, but has also been joined by international entrepreneurs.**\n@@ @@\n**Despite being approached by Aviatica several times, Eldröl Gérunda refused to comment.**[[/size]]\n[[/==]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n-----\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 25%\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: #d7003a; border: solid 1px #000000; border-radius: 3px; color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; width: 100%\"]]\n//Model 終-Y-1789//[[/div]][[image tree2.jpg width=\"300px\" style=\"border: 1px #B30030 solid; border-radius: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px; margin-top: 3px\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: #d7003a; border: solid 1px #000000; border-radius: 3px; color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; width: 100%\"]]\n//Prototypes of the Y01-β model, photographed during their growth at the JOICL research facility, shortly before being transported to Druv'tuul.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n**Product History:** The first plans to create 終-Y-1789 were made in 2031, when Druv'tuul became much more open to the international market. During this time, King Eldröl Gérunda directly approached JOICL and invited the company into the city with two purposes in mind: to introduce JOICL's products to a whole new market, and to ask for JOICL's aid. Seeing as how Druv'tuul is a biomechanical megapolis, the king needed JOICL's expertise to deal with some of the problems the city-state has been experiencing. With JOICL's help, the lines of crab-trains and dragonflies -- which have always been the main means of transportation in the city -- were finally upgraded and repaired, providing efficient transportation all throughout Druv'tuul.\n\nHowever, the king's plans did not end just with transportation. Since the dawn of time, the main currency operating in the city has been the Druv'tuulian Key, a product created as the fruit of the tree growing in the royal palace of Druv'tuul, fueled by the blood of its monarch. However, foreign investors -- including the houses of Darke and Marshall -- were not too keen on interacting with such a currency due to its highly centralized nature. So, in order to fully welcome his new free-market friends to the city, Gérunda hatched a plan from which, after consulting with JOICL, the first plans to create 終-Y-1789 emerged.\n\nAfter just two years of research, in 2033 JOICL succeeded in creating the first variants of 終-Y-1789. King Gérunda was delighted. In order to fully embrace the spirit of the free market -- which was the main idea behind 終-Y-1789 -- it was decided that multiple variants of the product would be created, rather than just the one that was suitable for the environment of Druv'tuul. Through further research, all of the currently available types of 終-Y-1789 were soon created and released onto the global market so that everyone could enjoy the promise of a better tomorrow, built through the hard work of free entrepreneurs.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[==]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 1.3em]]**[# Best]｜[# Newest]｜[# Breaking News]｜[# My Page]**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[size 0.85em]]unVeiled » [# Politics][[/size]]\n\n[[size 1.4em]]**The Dissatisfaction of Workers in Druv’Tuul Rises -- And With It, the Number of Riots**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 0.8em]]**By Alice Sharp (⁂ASharp)**\n**Published 17/05/2034, 17:30**[[/size]]\n\n[[image huta.png width=\"auto\" style=\"border: solid 1.5px #d7003a;\"]]\n\n[[size 0.8em]]The interior of one of the beryllium bronzeworks of Druv'tuul's Fourth Ring, now in the hands of Carter Heavy Industries.[[/size]]\n\nThe latest news from Druv'tuul indicate one thing: the people are furious. For years, Druv'tuul's economy has relied almost entirely on the excavation of rare raw materials from the caves surrounding the city and processing them in local plants. Thanks to the city's centralized economy -- focused entirely on preparing for the Sundown Ritual in the 20th century and on producing for the city itself in the 21st century -- every Druv'tuul resident was once able to find employment as part of a thriving organism that provided for the city's subsistence. But those days have long-passed.\n\nEver since King Eldröl Gérunda opened Druv'tuul up to multinational megacorporations, jobs that have once belonged to the city's residents are now being bought out by large private companies. These corporations come to the city with an already prepared foreign workforce to fill the factories and mines -- a workforce that is paid less than former Yeren laborers. Worse yet, ever since the king introduced his so-called \"Trees of Liberty\" into Druv'tuul's economy, local laid-off workers are not being compensated in real currencies, instead being paid in the vague products the Trees create.\n\nAll of these events -- combined with the king's remarkable incompetence in the past -- have pushed the people of Druv'tuul to use the only tool they still have left: civil unrest. For the past two weeks, 43% of the excavation Ring and 38% of the factory Ring of Druv'tuul have been on strike in the streets and factories. The workers are demanding the immediate withdrawal of the \"Trees of Liberty\" project and the return of the old order of things. They are even raising slogans such as \"Down with the Darkes!\", \"Capital go home!\" or \"* * * * | * * * * * * *.\" What, on the other hand, does the king have to say about this? Well, it doesn't seem that his majesty much cares...\n[[/==]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n-----\n\n**Opinions of Customers:**\n\n[[div style=\"background: #d7003a; border: solid 1px #000000; border-radius: 3px; color: #ffffff; padding: 0 1em 0 1em; margin: 0 10% 0.5em 10%\"]]\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n//A fantastic product and a fantastic producer.
