My author avatar, Dr. Everwood, is a GoI Researcher, my pet Site ([[[secure-facility-dossier-site-55|Site-55]]]!) is a GoI communications hub, and I have, at time of writing, written the most GoI formats out of anyone on the site. So it should go without saying that I probably know a lot about them. \n\nI know a lot of people view GoIs as nothing more than a vehicle by which to deliver anomalies to the Foundation, so I decided to write this series of essays to help encourage people to explore them a little more beyond that. There's a world of depth hiding out there in most of these GoIs, and even the shallow ones have a lot room to explore in. \n\nSo let's dive right in, shall we?\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* [[[the-big-goi-essay|GoI Field Guide]]] - This massive essay is unofficially the start of the series. It contains at least some information on 99% of the site's GoIs to some degree or another. It's a little outdated and doesn't go into as much detail as I would have wanted to, but it's still a good jumping off point if you're at all interested in Groups of Interest.\n* [[[gois-and-you-1|GoIs and You: The Most Misrepresented (dado and Gamers Against Weed)]]] - An essay covering the two most misrepresented and misunderstood Groups of Interest on the wiki; dado and GAW.\n* [[[gois-and-you-2|GoIs and You: The Real Adventures in Crapitalism, or, Alignment Chart Nonsense]]] - An essay covering the three GoIs that love capitalism the most; Wondertainment, the Factory, and MC&D.\n* [[[gois-and-you-3|GoIs and You: What the Fuck Is An Alexylva?]]] - An essay covering one of the more mysterious, least developed GoIs on the wiki; Alexylva University.\n* [[[gois-and-you-4|GoIs and You: Government Alphabet Soup]]] - An essay covering three of the national normalcy orgs.\n* [[[gois-and-you-5|GoIs and You: Random Grab Bag I]]] - An essay covering Nobody and the Spirit.\n* GoIs and You: Holy Heck! - Coming soon...",
