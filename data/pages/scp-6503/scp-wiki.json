The only known method to prevent SCP-6503's influence over a susceptible individual is immediate amnestic treatment after exposure. Failing this treatment, SCP-6503's effect is presumed to be permanent.

Its exterior is composed of an unidentified golden metal of remarkable durability. This durability is likely anomalous in nature; since SCP-6503-II is capable of withstanding modern heavy fire and artillery without suffering apparent damage. \n\nInternally, it possesses a complex clockwork mechanism allowing it to move. This mechanism does not require an external power source in order to function. SCP-6503-II is armed with several weapons; including both medieval bladed and blunt weaponry as well as anachronistic ones such as Gatling-type guns, flame throwers, and rocket launchers.

Mirage - Director of Site-77\n\n-----\n\n++++++ [BEGIN]\n\nIn the name of the Horizon Initiative and the Holy Church, I extend my gratitude to the Foundation for your invaluable assistance in containing SCP-6503, also known as the Benevento Heresy. This incident has evidenced Project Malleus' weakness and how vulnerable really is Christendom against the powers of the Unknown and their heretic machinations. But with God's Blessing, we are taking measures to sharpen Gladius Petri. The Foundation can rest assured that when another Blasphemy like the Benevento Heresy appears, we will be ready to unleash the wrath of God. And I say \"when\" instead of \"if\", since I am convinced more horrors will come from the same place to threaten the Mother Church.\n\nRegarding the Benevento Heresy, while it is certainly a Blasphemy, it is undeniable that it presents a unique opportunity to learn techniques more sophisticated than we have ever dreamed of. Reverse engineering is always a complicated and steady process; however, we are making progress and we believe, with God's Blessing, we will soon be able to produce a purified version of SCP-6503 for Gladius Petri. We  intend calling it Argentum Evangelium.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Silver Gospel. [[/span]]\n\nHis Holiness is deeply grateful for your help, but he also regrets having to hide while his flock fought God's hardest battle. When the next step of the Gladius Petri is complete, he will no longer have to hide again. He will drive the Argentum Evangelium and command the forces of Christendom against the Unknown, just as God intended. For the next time the Fires of Hell threaten our gates, His Holiness will fight Fire with Fire.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ Ordinis Occulti Luminis\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n-----\n\n++++++ [END]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6502]]] | SCP-6503 | [[[SCP-6504]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** wald.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Waldsassen Stiftsbasilika - Heiliger Leib 1a Gratian.jpg\n> **Author:** Wolfgang Sauber\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldsassen_Stiftsbasilika_-_Heiliger_Leib_1a_Gratian.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** mecha.jpg\n> **Name:** Imperial Knight Iron Will\n> **Author:**  Victor Ques Ramos\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/84366637@N04/42915545415\n\n> **Filename:** hori.png\n> **Name:** SCP Foundation / Horizon Initiative joint Logo\n> **Author:** Calibold\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:calibri-logos\n\n> **Filename:** blasphemia.svg\n> **Name:** Cruzar oro cristiano ortodoxo\n> **Author:** Pixabay\n> **License:** Pixabay License\n> **Source Link:** https://pixabay.com/de/vectors/kreuzen-gold-christian-orthodox-303723/\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
