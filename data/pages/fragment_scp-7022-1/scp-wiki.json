Once a protocol to decommission SCP-7022 has been devised, it is to be implemented with utmost haste.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7022 is the designation given to the Foundation's current state of decline in certain aspects such as government support, technological development, and available funding. This currently causes an increasing amount of problems such as mass containment breaches, issues regarding the funding of various projects, and the possibility of external Groups of Interest overtaking the Foundation in certain sectors of research or technology.\n\nWhile the cause of SCP-7022 is unknown, current theories vary from the possibility of SCP-7022 being non-anomalous to it being the result of an unknown entity. On discovery of the true nature of SCP-7022, the Overseer Council will convene to discuss adjusting the procedures for handling SCP-7022.\n\n//Nobody’s really sure what’s happening here.

Attempts to access security camera footage were unsuccessful. As a result, a task force battalion was quickly assembled in nearby Area-726 to arrive at the site on near thirty minutes notice.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Relevant File\" hide=\"- Close Relevant File\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n------\n\n++++ **Abridged Site Dossier: Site-19**\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=Site19\n| caption=Site-19, ground level.\n]]\n\n------\n\n//This file has one audio log attached.//\n\nAh, how good it is to be the Site Director at the largest (and nicest, I might add!) Foundation facility in the world. Hiding in plain sight right outside the city of Atlanta, we use an counterconceptual obscuring device, a machine developed from the fruits of our local antimemetic division's research. Many other sites have tried to replicate it, but we were the ones that made it work first, so a pat on the back for us!\n\nI still remember the good ol' days of the site in its early days, before we had all these fancy devices that keep us safe. I was only 22 years old, the youngest of any Site Director of my time, and yet I got appointed to be the guardian of what was then one of the more... lower quality sites around. Think less of a Foundation facility, and more like some Area-51 dump. So not very good, and we started with only a handful of anomalies and... I think around a hundred people? O, I forget the numbers, but you get my point.\n\nYou remember 173? //[Chuckle]// Oh, who am I kidding, you are probably rolling your eyes at my mere mention of it. It was one of our first, and hell, I even took the picture for the darn thing and put it on the file! But apparently that's \"unprofessional\" and... //[Distant murmuring]// ... oh, you hush, I'll rant all I goddamn want, its //my// memorandum! Hm, where was I? Oh, right, early days. I tried to live up to that one quote about a king leading his men into battle. Who said that? Sun Tzu?\n\nAnyways, I was much more of a risk taker then, and now I'm stuck in this damn wheelchair and can't do squat except paperwork! I had a dream, to expand our site as much as I damn well could and look where it got me! Our oh so hardworking team made discovery after discovery, creating new departments where applicable, and saved the world a couple times, here and there. Our tiny facility couldn't handle this amount of anomalies, so we had to keep expanding underground! This spiraled, and what the hell, you probably get what came next. 1 basement turned into 60 levels!\n\nI think us alone are now approaching nearly five thousand anomalies in our care. Quite a large number, I might add! Think about it, can you even name five thousand people? I think its made everything a bit confusing now. We now even have a group of Sub-Site Directors for micromanaging some things. Not what I imagined for a greater Site-19, but if it works, it works!\n\nRegardless, whether you are transferring over, trying to find information for an anomaly, or just browsing, I'm happy to have made your acquaintance, and I hope we can work together to make the best Foundation we can!
