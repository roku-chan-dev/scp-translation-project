I don't know if I've ever told this story here before, but my friend just passed away and I'm feeling vulnerable again, so I'm going to rant about my time in the cult, Just Girly Things. And yes, I am aware. I'm posting it __here__. What's KeeLee going to do, //manipulate me again//?\n\nGod, it's been years. And yet, not enough.\n\nI was young, I was stupid, and I was on the internet. Dangerous combination, I know. This was back in the days of Miniclip, when flash games having a screamer were the biggest threat you knew about online, before social media became a toxic wasteland. This was back when if you found a group of people online who you liked, who were like you, you would devote your entire after-school days to just reading, talking, anything.\n\nYou would wait, bored of school, bored of your part time job, bored of being at home, looking for any kind of community. Now back then, I was still a girl (lmao), and was tired of 'boys' telling me what I could or couldn't do. I needed to find other girls, other //women//, people I could talk to. People who would care about me, just as much as I wanted them to.\n\nThat was when I met KeeLee.\n\nPeople love to make jokes about how much they hate somebody online, or exaggerate things when telling a story, but I want to stop and make one thing clear: I hate KeeLee, she almost ruined my life, and if I got the chance, I would kill her so that she could never hurt anybody again. I hope you're reading this KeeLee, I'm going to ruin you. I am going to tell them everything.\n\nEventually. I'm sorry, I can't keep talking about this right now. It's fucked up, isn't it? Somebody is in our lives for only a short amount of time, a week, a month, and because of who they are, you are haunted by them for the rest of your life? Because of the things they did to //you//, the things they //made// you do, because you were too young and stupid to know any better -- and yet, if you start to say that they deserve to die, you're the one who is being unreasonable. You're the one who is 'just as bad' as they are. What the fuck kind of world do we live in?\n\nSorry. Sorry. I want to keep going, but I don't know if you're still here KeeLee. If you're reading this, if you've been waiting for me to crawl back to you... fuck, I don't even know if you'll remember me. I wish I didn't remember you.\n\nTo everybody else, if there is anybody out there, anybody on here who is unsure, I need to be clear.\n\nYou are not safe here. Leave. While you can.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ Comments\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[size 125%]]##hotpink|__KeeLee__##[[/size]] [[size small]]##hotpink|June 13th, 2022##[[/size]]\n\nThis is rather funny. I didn't think I'd ever see you again Daisy, not after you ran away when it got too hard for you. You know, not everybody is a natural mother, or caregiver. Sometimes you need to just dedicate yourself to something, devote yourself to somebody.\n\nNot that you would know anything about commitment. I mean, you even gave up on telling the story. I knew that you were a coward, but... Daisy, I expected more of you. I guess I failed you as a teacher.\n\nYou know where I am, when you're willing to accept that you were wrong. We've missed you.\n\n-----\n\n[[size 125%]]###569aac|__PutYourDukesUp__##[[/size]] [[size small]]###448ABF|June 13th, 2022##[[/size]]\n\n##hotpink|In response to:## ##hotpink|__KeeLee__##\n\nDaisy hasn't been my name in years, //not that you ever cared about what I want//.\n\nStill, what the fuck is wrong with you KeeLee?

Now I know that she can't love.\n\nShe doesn't know how to.\n\nI remember the first time we talked and just how it felt like the world was paying attention to //me//. The chatroom was silent, and in a server full of girls, her and I just talk to each other, for maybe... thirty minutes, an hour? And you made me feel like I was the most important girl in the world. You told me. You said 'Daisy, I am so glad you found your way to us. I can tell when a girl needs a good role model. You can always talk to me.'\n\nAnd like the lost lamb I was, I did. I talked to you every day. At first, I saw you as a mentor, a cool, older adult who could help me figure out who I really was. As we talked more and more, I realized that KeeLee saw me as a peer, as somebody she could be honest with. That's what she told me, and at the time, I thought I could trust her.\n\nSo I told her everything. I even shared pictures of me -- she called me //pretty//. God, even now, thinking back to the moment, I want to blush just as much as I want to vomit. It's like a disease that can't leave my body, and all these years later, I still see her pink name pop up and a part of me //shivers//. I was young, I was stupid, and I was falling for her. And still, she would talk about how I was special, about how it was so important that I was here, here now -- with her.\n\nI trusted her with everything.\n\nWe talked about hopes, fears, how lonely we felt and how frustrated we were that we didn't have a place in the world. We told each other how one day, we might be able to meet up, and how we would finally make up for lost time. How one day, we could all be our true selves.\n\nAt the time, I thought we were talking about the same thing. Now I see that I was dreaming of a life with her, while she was dreaming of the perfect life //for// me. With a man, as a loving, submissive wife. And her, doing the same thing, again, and again, and again.\n\nI was head over heels, and she knew it. She teased me about my 'crush', while I denied it. In reality, I was hanging off of every message she was sending me, each word shared between us a secret world we could live in. I was younger and naÃ¯ve, and in desperate need of attention; attention that KeeLee was more than happy to provide.\n\nOne day, I finally worked up enough courage. She had been hinting at it for months, saying that she thought I might be ready to take it to the next level. She kept asking me if I was ready to make a commitment, if I was willing to be the kind of girl KeeLee knew I could be. She fucking __knew__ what she was doing.\n\nAnd so I did it. In the middle of the day, in chat, with everybody else there to see just how stupid I was, how wrong I was, how much I truly needed to be saved.\n\nI asked her, I said:\n\n> ###F185AC|__DaisyChain__##: KeeLee. I really like you, and I know we've never met, but, would you want to maybe go on a digital date with me?\n\nIt didn't even take a second. She answered immediately.\n\n> ##hotpink|__KeeLee__##: Wait, what? Did you-- did you really think that I was gay? That I //liked// you? Gross. Daisy, you know being gay is wrong. Isn't it better to be with a man, to serve a loving husband? Don't you want to be a girly girl, like me?\n\nI was devastated -- and I was mocked, and shamed for what I was. And the worst part was, god, I was so fucking desperate for approval that I __apologized__. I BEGGED for help, for a way to fix my curse, a way to be better. KeeLee acted like nothing had changed, that we were still best friends -- as long as I knew that it was wrong for me to want to be with a woman, and that she could fix me, I could stay her friend. And I would have given anything up to spend one more minute with her.\n\nAnd maybe she was right. Maybe I was sick, and she knew best.\n\nFor years, I fucking listened to her every word, I lived and breathed the Girly lifestyle. I tried to force myself to love a man, to be the girl KeeLee told me I was, tried to squeeze myself into a little box, just so that I could still have a place here. At first, all I would do was freak out that I could never be right, and that some part of me would always want to be with a woman -- what could I possibly do differently?\n\nThis was about the time I realized that I might be transgender. Of course, you know what KeeLee feels about that, she's not shy about it. And she definitely didn't pull any punches back then.\n\n> ##hotpink|__KeeLee__##: Are you really that confused Daisy? I know we've been working on correcting your twisted view on homosexuality, but I never expected that you would be one of //them//. You're not a boy, you're not somewhere in between -- you're just a silly, confused girl, in desperate need of attention. Well, congratulations. You have it now.\n\nShe sent me a direct message almost immediately after, and I scrambled to see what she was going to tell me, maybe that she could even understand me? Again, I should have known much, much better.\n\n> ##hotpink|__KeeLee__##: I will never let you go, not until you are the girl you are meant to be. You need to trust me, I know what is best for you sweetie. You know that, right?\n\nI left the site that day, something deep inside of me woke up, screaming that this was //wrong//, that I wasn't safe here. It was like I had woken up from a nightmare, except it was real, and I had to pick up the pieces of my life. I just knew that it would be impossible for me to do, as long as KeeLee was whispering into my ear. I knew I had to leave.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ Comments\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[size 125%]]##hotpink|__KeeLee__##[[/size]] [[size small]]##hotpink|June 16th, 2022##[[/size]]\n\nDaisy, I know that you think this is going to devastate me, that your recounting of the 'abuse' I gave you will change everything.

I know this, because I see it every day.\n\nYou are just as lost as you were before, and I can't help you until you are willing to accept that.\n\nAll of these negative emotions, all of this anger, hatred, fear -- wouldn't you rather not have to worry about any of that?

You've spent so long believing that KeeLee was abusive that you've completely forgotten what it means to be a girl.

KeeLee won't hurt anybody else, ever again.\n\nIt was easier than I expected. KeeLee didn't even bother to mask her IP address, and between that and geolocational data from when her phone connected to chat, it wasn't hard to figure out exactly where KeeLee lived. Guess all those coding lessons you gave me worked out in the end, huh?\n\nIt wasn't a very long drive, plus my partner came with me. They refused to let me go alone, but once we got to KeeLee's house... I knew I had to do this alone. She didn't even have her doors locked. I guess she really did believe in what she preached. It was easy enough to make my way through her house, until I heard a faint humming in the room just around the corner.\n\nYou know, you all see her as an idea, as this holy figure who is going to lead you to salvation. You couldn't be more wrong. \n\nI walked into the room, an office, and saw her from behind at first. She was sitting at her keyboard, scrolling this website, singing softly. Peaceful, almost. But that wouldn't change what was going to happen next. Because what I did next proved that she was mortal.\n\nThe truth is, when I found her in person, I finally realized what KeeLee was. All of these years I had built up KeeLee as this master manipulator, as a force of evil, determined to corrupt the minds of young girls. I thought she was the devil. The truth is much more boring than that. She's not an idea, she's not a digital boogeyman, she's no martyr -- she was just a sad, lonely woman, full of hate.\n\nShe didn't even beg for her life when I held the gun to her head.\n\nKeeLee is dead. We won.

My name is Daisy (she/they), the current admin of Just Girly Things. I recently helped liberate JGT from KeeLee, a relic of the past who refused to accept change. I helped give JGT a new mission: To teach anybody about the great world of girly things, and to show that you don't have to be a girl to enjoy Just Girly Things.\n\nUnfortunately, KeeLee misled so many of you lovely ladies, corrupting you and twisting your view of this cruel world. With the new Just Girly Things, my mission is to show girls that they can be whoever they want. Everyone needs some help sometimes, and I am honor to be able to give them what they need. All of the girls, gays and theys who call this site home -- they care too, so feel free to contact any of us if you need some help!\n\nNever forget -- you are not enough. Not until you've accepted the truth; girlhood will always be in your heart. There is no one way to be a girl, and I promise you that if you listen to me, and follow my guidance, you will be able to be the happiest girl you could dream of. We have tons of new blog posts, articles and more about just how damaging KeeLee's way of thinking was, so please take a moment and re-educate yourselves. As long as you listen to those, you'll be fine. I know that until recently, I hated Just Girly Things with a passion -- now I see just how much good it can do.\n\nThings have changed. JGT without KeeLee is great! It's queer-positive, reformed, and an awesome place. You should totally join us, babe!\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"color: hotpink; font-size: 125%;\"]]\n\n@@ @@\nHow sweet.

You couldn't ever dream of beating me, because, at the end of the day, you know one simple truth: I'm right. I always will be.\n\nBut it's okay. Take your time. 'Fight the good fight'.
