It tugged on my heartstrings so much that I decided to sit down and draw an article from their discography. After scrolling through their author page for a brief while, I landed on this one.\n\nI remembered reading it before, and I remembered reading through the dialogue thinking how raw it felt. It was like experiencing an actual conversation from an outside perspective (which makes sense given the context of it). I almost forgot this was about a talking bomb. In a way, it felt rather endearing, to the point I could imagine everything that's happening in the narrative. Very vividly, too.\n\nMassive props to Nico for both of these articles. Pretty good shit, I do say. And to everyone else reading in the month this is coming out, happy pride month. New article coming soon.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ //What a Lovely Day!//\n+++ Check out my other 'doodles' [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/winkwonk-doodles here.]\n@@ @@\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]",
