This space consists of a 49-acre forest populated entirely with Scots pine trees, in order to obfuscate and protect the identity of the true SCP-6900. The location of SCP-6900 and maintenance of its containment unit is restricted exclusively to individuals with Level 5/6900-Alpha clearance.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6900 is a single Scots pine tree (//Pinus sylvestris//). In terms of its appearance, SCP-6900 is indistinguishable from other trees of its type.\n\nThe female pine cones which grow from SCP-6900 have a variety of anomalous effects. The seed scales, despite not being edible on a non-anomalous Scots pine, are edible and nutritious, and noted by test subjects for their high-quality taste. Consumption of these scales provides significant improvements to overall physical health, eliminating fatigue and weakness, and curing or strongly diminishing most illnesses. The stems of SCP-6900's cones are made entirely of diamond, and are surrounded by a thin layer of bark.\n\nSCP-6900 itself has an anomalous effect on those who maintain or care for it[[footnote]]Such as through watering it, providing nourishment, keeping it free of predators or parasites, etc.[[/footnote]]. While within an approximately 10-kilometer radius of SCP-6900, affected individuals will experience strong positive enhancements to their strength, dexterity, skill, and mental health.\n\n[[=]]\n\n------\n\n+ **Addendum 6900.1**\n\n------\n\n[[/=]]\n\nAn emergency assembly was called by Site-19's Director Barnes and MTF-Delta-12's Riley Parr regarding an apparent threat to SCP-6900's containment.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**In attendance:**\n\n* Dir. Adam Barnes: Director of Site-19\n* Dr. Julia Vaughn: Lead Researcher for SCP-6900\n* Cpt. Riley Parr: Captain of MTF Delta-12 (\"Burning Down The House\")\n* Dr. Carter Shalamov: Site-19's HMCL[[footnote]]Hazardous Materials Containment Liaison[[/footnote]]\n* Dir. Calvin Bold: Director of the Decommissioning Department\n* Det. Quinn Roscoe: Site-19's Chief of Investigation\n\n------\n\n**Barnes:** Alright, let's begin the log. Thank you for coming, everyone.\n\n**Shalamov:** What is this about, anyway? The memo did not provide much information.\n\n**Parr:** I'm afraid that was necessary. This involves some recent leaks, and until we can determine the extent of those leaks, we can't risk information being lost.\n\n**Roscoe:** I thought we were getting together for chili night.\n\n//[A few moments of silence. Shalamov sighs.]//\n\n**Roscoe:** Fine, sorry. Didn't realize y'all hated jokes.\n\n**Barnes:** Anyway, in front of all of you is the current file for SCP-6900. If you'll take a moment to read it...\n\n//[Everyone opens their files and reads through SCP-6900.]//\n\n**Bold:** Pretty short.\n\n**Vaughn:** Not much to say about it. As for this meeting, director, why wasn't I briefed on this? If 6900 is relevant here, then I should be the first to know.\n\n**Parr:** This is less about 6900 itself and more about— Well, Adam, why don't you start. With the beginning of all this.\n\n**Barnes:** //[Nods]// Right. Two weeks ago, the Site-19 secure database was breached, and an infiltrator was able to access all files for any clearance level. In particular, they downloaded all information relating to SCP-6900. Not just the standard file, but containment specs, reports, test logs, notes, et cetera. Naturally, we alerted Vaughn and anyone else involved, so most of you were already aware of this incident.\n\n**Bold:** Makes sense. Did you find out who the infiltrator was?\n\n**Barnes:** Yes. The reason we didn't want to discuss this at first was because while we were able to partially determine their activity, we don't know the full extent of what they viewed, or whether or not they could do it again. We don't want them to catch on.\n\n**Shalamov:** So who was the intruder?\n\n**Barnes:** //[Clears throat]// Parr, if you will.\n\n//[Parr holds out a remote and turns on the conference room's projector.]//\n\n**Parr:** This is Dr. Giaco Capo, but some of you may know him by the name \"Game Master,\" a former member of the House of Stars.\n\n//[The attendees display visible discomfort.]//\n\n**Bold:** Sorry, should I know what that is?\n\n**Parr:** How— I forget you're fairly new. The House of Stars is an old Group of Interest that was active until about twelve years ago. Their main deal was pulling off big heists against anomalous groups. They hit a few Foundation targets, as well as the GOC, MC&D, basically any group with something valuable. My force, Delta-12, was assigned to them until they became inactive. We don't entirely know why they disbanded, but our best theory is that there was some kind of schism. After that, all of their members laid low.\n\n**Vaughn:** Well, I assume that means Game Master is acting independently?\n\n**Parr:** Not... quite. Two days after he infiltrated 19, we received intel that he was possibly working with another House member, who goes by \"Sheriff.\"\n\n**Roscoe:** So what? What's his goal here?\n\n**Parr:** Two things. First, it's likely they're going after SCP-6900. But also... I believe he may be trying to reassemble the House of Stars.\n\n//[Some outcry ensues amongst the attendees.]//\n\n**Barnes:** We're not sure what the extent of this is. But we're keeping tabs on any possible members, and we'll be providing everyone with information on them. Our best course of action is to reinforce ourselves and SCP-6900.\n\n//[Parr clears her throat.]//\n\n**Barnes:** Unless worse comes to worst, of course.\n\n**Roscoe:** What's that supposed to mean?\n\n**Parr:** Barnes is concerned with the potential loss of resources and personnel involved with stopping this, especially if things get deadly. Personally, I think it's worth the risk to try and stamp out the House now.\n\n**Barnes:** I'll be assisting with a proposal to decommission the House or 6900 if need be, especially if they keep coming back to try and take the item.\n\n**Bold:** So that's why I'm here.\n\n**Barnes:** We wanted to make sure all relevant departments are in on this. That includes yours, Director.\n\n**Bold:** There's certainly stipulations to destroy an anomaly if we can't keep it out of enemy hands. But the way you're referring to the House of Stars, it seems like there's only a few members.\n\n**Parr:** Precisely the problem. We're prepared to deal with full-scale containment breaches and incursions, but the House is tricky. All of their members are able to elude capture, and they've demonstrated resounding success. And that's why we need 6900. As bait.\n\n**Vaughn:** Hold on! I was //never// consulted on this! 6900 is //my// project, and I'm not letting you come in and blow it up!\n\n**Parr:** Vaughn, this is more important than a single pine tree. And we're not completely certain if we'll even need to destroy it anyway.\n\n**Vaughn:** But—!\n\n**Parr:** Enough! //[Hits table.]// You don't know them like I do. They're dangerous, and we need to get rid of them while we have the chance.\n\n//[Brief silence.]//\n\n**Bold:** Fine. I'll consider the request when it comes through.\n\n**Barnes:** One last thing. //[Points to Roscoe]// I want a thorough investigation while all this is going down. We have to catch anything suspicious.\n\n**Roscoe:** Yep, got it.\n\n**Parr:** Alright then. Let's burn down the house.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n------\n\n+ **Addendum 6900.2**\n\n------\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Casefile 727-6900]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div class=\"cover-page\"]]\n\n+ CASEFILE 727-6900\n\nThis file contains information regarding the recent activities of GoI-727 (\"The House of Stars\") in regards to SCP-6900, specifically all members known to have been in contact with PoI-727-1 (\"Game Master\").

He claims to have graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with PhDs in statistics and physics[[footnote]]While this claim remains dubious, he possesses extensive knowledge of both subjects.[[/footnote]]. He is a potent tychokinetic, giving him a high degree of probability manipulation. Limited analysis of these capabilities suggests that he may be host to a foreign entity which grants him these properties.\n\nGame Master is one of the founding members of the original House of Stars, alongside PoI-727-2 (\"Sheriff\"), -3 (\"King\"), and -4 (\"Chef\"). Game Master would often operate as the face of the House, utilizing a combination of connections, charisma, and his own anomalous abilities to push the House's agenda. When the House first disbanded, Game Master went into deep hiding and posed as a Foundation researcher named \"Giaco Capo.\" As [[[SCP-040]]], another House member, had frequently used her own anomalous abilities to disguise Game Master and other members, he went unrecognized during his time at the Foundation.\n\nAfter several years, Game Master managed to attain unauthorized access to the Site-19 Secure Archives before fleeing the site (see file below). While fleeing, [[[Friends Of Us Never Die|he was able to steal SCP-963; it is believed he reconnected with Sheriff shortly afterwards.]]] Currently, he is the primary instigator of the House of Star's ongoing reformation.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[Location is Site-19 Secure Archives. Dr. Giaco Capo walks in and locks the door behind him. He walks to the central terminal and inserts a thumb drive into it. Analysis post-incident reveals that the thumb drive contained a program which would allow access into secure files without triggering any alarms or security protocols.]//\n\n//[Capo peruses the Level 5 secure files for several minutes, before reaching the SCP-6900 folder. After reading through the main file, he downloads the folder into his drive, activating Secure Contingency Protocol Alpha-3.]//\n\n**Capo:** Oh. That's not good.\n\n//[Capo removes the drive and places it into his pocket. He makes no effort to hurry as he looks around the room. Foundation agents can be heard on the other side of the entrance, attempting to access the room.]//\n\n**Agent:** I can't get in, it's jammed!\n\n//[Capo walks over to the nearest vent and climbs inside. He is able to make his way into the primary ventilation system and escape Site-19. While security protocols were in place to prevent unauthorized movement through the ventilation system, a previously unknown bug in the central security system prevented them from activating while Secure Contingency Protocol Alpha-3 was active. Shortly thereafter, security agents are able to breach the room.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab PoI-727-2 (\"Sheriff\")]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6900/Sheriff.png\n| caption=Sheriff.\n| width=200px]]\n\n++ PoI-727-2 (\"Sheriff\")\n\n**Aliases:** Sheriff\n\n**Status:** ##red|WANTED##\n\n**Disturbance Level:** ##gold|3 (Moderate)##\n\n**Threat Level:** ##orange|4 (High)##\n\n**Affiliation:** House of Stars\n\n**Anomalous Capabilities:** Level IV Telekinesis\n\n**Overview:** Sheriff is a human male with telekinetic capabilities, estimated to be between 35 and 40 years of age. His personal life is largely unknown, and he bears a reputation for being taciturn. In addition to his primary anomalous properties, he is in possession of the Everycloak and Everyblade, two artifacts capable of limited transformation into various clothing and weaponry, respectively.\n\nSheriff is one of the founding members of the House of Stars, and even worked privately alongside several of its to-be members before the House was officially established. While there is no evidence that the House possessed any kind of centralized leadership or hierarchy, it is believed that Sheriff was considered the //de facto// leader of the House.\n\nShortly after Game Master fled Site-19, him and Sheriff reconnected and began rebuilding the House. His activity remains largely unknown, save for a single log attached below. Game Master had made a single call to him from a payphone, which was flagged due to voice recognition and keyword triggering.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Game Master:** Sherf. It's me.\n\n**Sheriff:** Where are you calling from?\n\n**GM:** A payphone. It's a long story, I know, they'll be able to listen in.\n\n**Sheriff:** That was stupid of you.\n\n**GM:** I'm //sorry//. Listen, I'll get back home soon.\n\n**Sheriff:** Why are you calling me?\n\n**GM:** I've been looking around. Luck's on my side, but even so, it's difficult.\n\n**Sheriff:** Are there any updates?\n\n**GM:** Babel's in, although it took some persuasion to get them onboard. Chef's taken by the Coalition, he might be tough to bust out. Cheems tried to deconceptualize me the moment I knocked on his door, but we all saw //that// coming.

He has been engaging in criminal activity since the age of 14, both independently and amongst other groups. He is widely regarded as a particularly skilled criminal, to the point where anomalous individuals and groups began reaching out to him a few years into his career.\n\nDespite possessing no anomalous capabilities, Chef is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous members of the House of Stars, due to his skill, intellect, and overall aptitude. He is believed to be the mastermind behind most of their projects and heists.\n\nChef formally left the House shortly over a year before it officially dissolved, for unknown reasons. Shortly thereafter, he was detained by the Global Occult Coalition, where he remained in custody until recently.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//**Note:** The following file was provided by the Global Occult Coalition, upon request by the SCP Foundation.//\n\n------\n\n//[Location is outside the entrance to Chef's cell.

A metal tile floats off of the floor, and Game Master and Sheriff emerge.]//\n\n**Game Master:** If we have time, can we steal this guy's concert ticket?\n\n//[Sheriff does not respond. He faces the entrance and holds up his hands. The door shakes, and after a moment, it slowly removes itself and falls onto the ground. The two of them step inside.]//\n\n//[Feed switches to the cell's interior. Chef is seen on the other side of a reinforced glass wall. Game Master and Sheriff both step into the containment unit.

Upon initial recovery, her biokinetic capabilities were relatively limited. As she aged, however, she gradually became more powerful, as well as less compliant with Foundation containment.

Well, I'm glad to see someone taking the reins on that. Sometimes you have to cut your losses, especially in this business. It's part of why I wanted you in on the whole 6900 thing.\n\n**Bold:** Oh.

The House isn't all hell-bent on destruction, but I lost a few good teammates to them.\n\n**Bold:** I'm... sorry to hear that.\n\n**Parr:** Hearing they were back was... do you know what it's like? Finally thinking you've beaten something terrible, only for it to come back again? I think you do.\n\n**Bold:** Why are you telling me all this?\n\n**Parr:** Because I have a plan. I want the House gone. For good. And I'm planning on using 6900 to do so.\n\n**Bold:** Ah. I see now. And you want me to just... authorize it?\n\n**Parr:** You're a smart guy, from what I've seen. This is about saving lives, lives which are put at risk by letting the House run around all crazy.\n\n**Bold:** And you thought your best course of action was to meet me in secret? Try and nudge me onto your side? Even if you could do that, there are rules and processes in place. This was your plan?\n\n**Parr:** Not quite. I had more to offer, but you're right.

The Decommissioning Department and the Security Department have both agreed that the use of SCP-6900 as a form of bait in order to activate Protocol 451 (see attached file) is the most effective method of neutralizing the House of Stars.\n\nIntelligence provided by Captain Parr has also been highly useful, and has only furthered this decision. Should the House of Stars escape, they will more than likely make another attempt to capture the object, further risking loss of personnel and resources. This, along with other classified details, have cemented our choice here.\n\nThis was a difficult decision to make, but ultimately a necessary one. Protocol 451 is the best method of countering the anomalous properties of the House of Stars, particularly those speculated to trigger Protocol 451.\n\n— Dir. Calvin Bold, Decom.

Naturally, this won't be the only action we take. Delta-12 will be significantly reduced in size, and placed directly under the supervision of myself; additionally, you will also be reporting to Dr. Julia Vaughn, until you manage to retrieve what the House stole from SCP-6900-D.
