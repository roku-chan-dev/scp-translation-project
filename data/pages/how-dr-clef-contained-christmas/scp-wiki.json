The whole Christmas time!\nBut please do not ask him. He might rip out your spine.\n\nIt could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.\nIt could be, perhaps, that his hat was too tight.\nBut I think the most likely reason for this,\nWas the hate in his heart for all of the Skips.\nFor whatever the reason - His hate, heart, or hat -\nHe stood there on Christmas Eve, suspicious of all that,\nStaring down the hallway with a rigid, concerned walk,\nAt the warm-lit containment cells all in his block.\n\nFor he knew every Skip contained on his block\nWas busy now, with the whole Christmas crock.\n\"The specimen of SCP-610 is hanging entrails on the wall!\"\nHe puzzled over this behavior, but who should he call? \nStill puzzled, his fingers were nervously drumming,\n\"Other Skips are preparing!  Is there a Christmas Breach coming‽\"\nThen he growled, all alone in the observation room.\n\"I MUST learn how to stop this Christmas Breach soon!\"\n\nFor Tomorrow, he knew, all the Skips down the block,\nWould wake bright and early. Might break all their locks!\nAnd then! Oh, the Noise! Oh, the Noise!\nNoise! Noise! Noise!\nThat's one thing he hated! The NOISE!\n**NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!**\nThen the Skips, young and old, might break out and feast.\nAnd they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST!\n**FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!**\n\nThey might feast on researchers, guards, and the director.\nSomething Dr. Clef would not tolerate in this sector!\nAnd THEN They might do something He hated, He did,\nEvery Skip down in Nineteen, Keter and Euclid,\nMight break out altogether, with SCP-513 ringing.\nThey'd run hand-in-hand. And the Skips would start killing!\nThey'd kill! And they'd kill! And they'd KILL!\n**KILL! KILL! KILL!**\n\nAnd the more Dr. Clef thought of this whole Skip Christmas Evil,\nThe more Dr. Clef thought, \"I need to stop this upheaval!\"\n\"We can't afford a K-class scenario now!\"\n\"I MUST stop this Christmas Breach from coming! But HOW?\"\nThen he got an idea! A sexy idea!\n\nDR. CLEF GOT A WONDERFUL, __SEXY__ IDEA!\n\n\"I know just what to do!\" Dr. Clef smiled in his room.\nAnd he requisitioned a D-class jumpsuit and broom.\nAnd he chuckled, and clucked, \"What a great fucking sham!\"\n\"With this getup and broom, It'll look like testing as planned!\"\n\"All I need is a helper...\" Dr. Clef looked around.\nBut, since helpers were scarce, there were none to be found.\nDid that stop the old Doctor? No! Dr. Clef simply said,\n\"If I can't find a helper, I'll call a favor instead!\"\n\nSo he called his friend, Dmitri. And evacuated the base,\nThen he armed the Site's nuclear device... just in case.\nTHEN He took guns and amnestics from the site's armory vault, \nGave some to Dmitri and said, \"Blow the site, if I'm caught.\" \n\"The nuke's down the hall.  That's Plan B if I'm dead.\"\n\"Da,\" said Dmitri, and followed where it led.\nAnd Dr. Clef gave a sigh, and headed on down,\nToward the cell block where Skips Lay asnooze all around.\n\nAll their cells were dark. Eerily quiet was the air.\nSkips were all dreaming horrific dreams without care.\nWhen he came to the first little cell on the square.\n\"This is stop number one,\" the old mirthless Doc hissed,\nAnd he climbed through the vent, amnestic syringe in his fist.\nThen he slid down the air ducts. He was actually quite deft.\nIf the old Grinch could do it, then so could the Clef.\n\nHe got stuck only once, for a moment or two.\nThen he slithered out of the ventilation chute.\nWhere peculiar stockings all hung in a row.\n\"This contraband,\" he grinned, \"are the first things to go!\"\nThen he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,\nAround the room, and he took every unauthorized present!\nCandy! And Spiders! Tinsel! And Crud!\nStill-borns! Ornaments! Mucus! And Blood!\n\nAnd he stuffed them in trash bags. Then Clef, a bit later,\nStuffed all the bags in the incinerator!\nThen he slunk to Control.  He locked down the whole block!\nHad his dick been anomalous, he'd have locked up his cock!\nHe closed every bulkhead as quick as a flash.\nWhy, that Doctor even locked the dumpster for trash!\nThen he burned all the contraband with victorious glee.\n\"And NOW!\" grinned Dr. Clef, \"I'll lock down SCP-173!\"\n\nAnd Dr. Clef grabbed the keys, and he started to open,\nWhen he heard a small sound like the chill of an omen.\nHe turned around fast, and he saw a small Skip!\nSCP-191 was at the door, who was not more than four.\nDr. Clef had been caught by this anomalous Belle,\nWho'd awoke and quite slipped out of her cell.\n\nShe stared at Dr. Clef and said, \"A D-class, why,\nWhy are you locking down our Christmas things? WHY?\"\nBut, you know, that old Doctor was so smart and so slick,\nHe thought of a reply, and he thought it up quick!\n\n//**\"GET THE FUCK! BACK!  GET THE FUCKING FUCK BACK!\"**//\n\nThen he brought out his gun and fired a whole lot,\nBut that Skip was so quick, that it dodged all his shots.\nIt slashed and it gashed against Dr. Clef's skin,\nBut that crafty Clef knew she was close enough in,\nThat he pricked her with the amnestics syringe.\n\nShe blinked, for it shocked her,\nShe stopped as she faltered,\nShe forgot why she even attacked the poor doctor.\nDr. Clef gave a shove.  And he shoved her right in,\nRight over the railing into 173's pen.\n\nThen he gathered his keys and locked up containment.\nHe thought it was quite the clever detainment.\nWith blood on the floor, he gathered himself,\nKeyed up the radio and leaned on the shelf,\n\"Dmitri come in, I got hurt rather bad.\nBe on standby, there's a few more things to be had.\"\n\"Da,\"  Said Dimitri, finger on the red button.\nWatching the cameras for a signal or somethin'.\n\nIt was quarter past dawn... Lockdown was in full effect,\nAll the Skips still contained,  All the locks were all checked!\nPacking up his shit, Dr. Clef headed back up,\nBack to his office to start to cleanup.\nWith a crooked smile, he grinned at his work,\nHe laughed as he limped and he said with a smirk,\n\n\"PoohPooh to the Skips!\" he was mirthlessly humming.\n\"They're finding out that no Christmas Breach is coming!\nThey're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!\nTheir maws will hang open a moment or two,\nThen the Skips down in Nineteen will all cry BooHooHoo!\"\n\"That's a noise,\" grinned Dr. Clef, \"That I simply MUST hear!\"\nSo he paused. And Dr. Clef put his hand to his ear.\nAnd he did hear was sound that starting to flow.\nIt started in low. Then it started to grow.\n\nBut the sound wasn't mad! Why, this sound sounded merry!\nIt couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! **VERY!**\nHe stared down at the cell block! Dr. Clef popped his eyes!\nThen he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!\nEvery Skip down in Nineteen, the tall and the small,\nWere singing! Without any breaches at all!\nHe HADN'T stopped Skip Christmas from coming! IT CAME!\nSomehow or other, it came just the same!\n\nAnd Dr. Clef, with his bloodied chest looking low,\nStood puzzling and puzzling: \"How could it be so?\nIt came without killing! It came without breaches!\nIt came without blood, destruction or screeches!\"\nAnd he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.\nThen Dr. Clef  thought of something he hadn't before!\n\"Maybe Skip Christmas,\" he thought, \"isn't something to lock up.\"\n\n,,\"Maybe Skip Christmas...perhaps...it's a chance to make up.\",,\n\nAnd what happened then? Well...in Nineteen they say,\nThat Dr. Clef's hateful heart melted that day!\nAfter a minute, when his heart didn't feel quite so tight,\nHe whizzed past the Control Room, undid the locks from last night,\nAnd opened the cells! Let loose all the Skips!\nGave back the contraband he did not burn in his trip!\n\n\"Merry Skip-mas!\", said bloodied Clef as he came down for hugs.\n\"Merry Skip-mas!\", said the Skips as they hugged back with some snugs.\nWith tentacles, claws, hands, and [REDACTED]\nAll grudges on Christmas were simply retracted.\n\n\"Wait!\" cried Clef as he shook the hand of a spook.\n\"I should call my friend before he blows up the--\"\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/how-dr-clef-contained-christmas/nuke.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n\nAnd then they all died.\n\n[[div style=\"text-shadow: #003 1px 1px;\"]]\n+ ##red|T####green|H####white|E## ##red|E####green|N####white|D##\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n> ,,† The following content is a fan-based parody of a satirical nature protected under Fair-Use that is based off of the children's book \"__How the Grinch Stole Christmas!__\" by Theodor \"Dr. Seuss\" Geisel.,,\n\n> ,,† \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) Artist: https://www.twinmusicom.org/,,\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** christmas_pattern_low_con.jpg\n> **Name:** Christmas Pattern\n> **Author:** dryicons, [[*user LurkD]]\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://dryicons.com/vector/christmas-pattern|Link]]]\n\n> **Filename:** nuke.jpg\n> **Name:** Operation Upshot-Knothole - Badger 001.jpg\n> **Author:** National Nuclear Security Administration / Nevada Site Office\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
