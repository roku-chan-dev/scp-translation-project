  "content": "##green|When Shout in Whispers woke up, he opened his eyes to the table moving  away from him, and his bare feet dangling over the floor. His wrists felt choked by two insistent, firm grips; someone else’s arms were criss-crossing his torso from behind. Someone’s heavy, grunting breath  blew in his ears. His body felt so rubbery and foreign to him that it didn’t even occur to him to resist at first. It wasn’t until he smelt the woody, fresh dewed-grass scent of his wife’s perfume tinged with sweat that his motor skills returned to him. He jerked and spasmed from recognition. His and her screams were a synchronized surprise.##\n\nNever Fades Away broke her grip on his torso, and she fell backwards against the door behind her with a thud; he sank to the ground like a cast off sack of potatoes. While their hearts slowed to a more manageable gallop, they screamed all kinds of compound variations of the words “fuck”, “shit,” and “damn,” not at each other, but towards the walls and upholstery and lights and towards whatever invisible god the shock put the fear of into them. \n\nThere was a sound of loud and eagerly answered gunfire booming on the floor above. Shout in Whispers and Never Fades Away screamed again and simultaneously clapped their hands over their mouths while looking at the ceiling.\n\nAs they continued listening to the screams and bellowed commands above them, their eyes then moved to each other. Shout in Whispers began to breathe more easily. Because real words were still a struggle for him, he tried to read his wife’s appearance for a clue about what was happening inside her. Her eyes bored into his, likely making the same attempt. \n\n\"How are you doing?\" Shout leaned against a wall to steady himself.\n\nFades coughed and closed her eyes for a moment, and Shout smiled, knowing she was readjusting her mental armor, rather than let Shout see her rattled. “I…I…you should be…I should be asking you that same question.” She said.\n\n“My head feels like somebody used a hornet’s nest for a pinata, and my brain was the stick.\" He tried to laugh, but violently coughed instead. Actually, could use some mouth-to-mouth-”\n\n\"Shhh! Head in the game, Shout.\"\n\n\"God damn, Fades, you okay? You look awful.\" Shout said. He noticed the blood on Fades' white uniform, and one of her hands seemed red and bruised. as though she'd punched someone.\n\n“I…I…you should be…I should be asking you that same question.” Fades said.\n\n“My head feels like somebody used a hornet’s nest for a pinata, and my brain was the stick.” Shout laughed. “Actually, could use some mouth-to-mouth-”\n\n“Shhh!” Fades put a finger to her lips. “Head in the game, Shout.”\n\n“Why? Your sad eyes are almost as irresistible as your happy ones.”\n\n“We’re probably going to die,” She shook her head. “But I wanna go out swinging, so I need-”\n\n“Are you telling me flirting doesn’t cheer you up-” Shout said.\n\n“Shh!” Fades said. “I can't do this right now. I have to save you, okay? I have to save you.”\n\nShe swallowed, and then bracing herself against the nearby desk, rose to her feet, still looking at \nShout. “Nod or shake your head, please. Can you walk?” \n\nBetween the adrenaline in the moment, and his confusion, Shout seemed to have lost the rubber in his legs. He jumped to his feet, and tilted his head as if to say, “Go on.” \n\nFades nodded. “Crouch, right behind me, okay?”\n\nShout nodded. Fades opened the door, and they ran down the long, deserted hallway. Shout initially didn’t recognize the blood-red kill-agent splashed on the wall opposite the door that would have given him and Fades a stroke had they not been properly inoculated against them (a safety precaution the O5s granted Level Five staff when orders for the Internment had gone out).The walls, floor and ceiling were otherwise white and spotless. \n\nFades ran to the partially opened elevator door, and immediately tried to pry it open. Shout noticed her struggling and added his weight to hers, sitting on the ground and pressing his feet into the frame to help yank the door open the rest of the way. Their attempts came to an abrupt halt when they heard the sound of multiple feet pounding on the roof of the elevator. “Fuck,” Fades whispered. \n“Come on!”\n\nThey backed away from the elevator and ran down the hallway, but then an explosion boomed at the other end. From the cloud of smoke and debris, armed soldiers filed out. Fades recognized the soldiers’ visors from filching her mom’s intel on the US Navy’s technological capability. Shout recognized the bizarre diversity and modernity of their rifles: polished and metallic looking HK416s, long barreled M1A4s, and a very non-standard variant of a grenade launcher.\n\n“Seal Team Six?” they both said. \n\n“Hands in the air!” The man in front said. “Move!” They did as they were told.\n\n\"I have a pistol under my shirt; safety's off!\" Fades said \"If you're looking for a reason to shoot me, just get it over with.\" Shout wanted to tell her to stop being so stupid, but fear choked his words out of his throat. He hated how sick he got at the sight of violence, threatened or otherwise. \n\n\"Do what I say and you've got nothing to fear. Fuck around, and I'll drop you where you stand,\" the presumed leader of the squad said. \"Take your left hand and pull out your pistol by slide with your thumb and forefinger.\"\n\nFades obliged.\n\n\"Good. Now place it on the ground, turn on the safety, and lay it at your feet.\" The gun gently clicked on the ground. \"Stand back up. Brigand, go over and secure the weapon. Thunder, Mercury and Nine-ball, keep your sights on the HVTs, make sure to airhole them if they test us.\" The soldier named Brigand picked the gun up. “Okay, you two, on your knees, hands locked before your head.\"\n\n“Fine!” Fades said, “Fine!” Wordlessly, three of the troops ran over and roughly grabbed Fades’ hands and harshly yanked them behind her hard enough that she gasped in surprise.\n\n“Stop hurting my wife, you piece of shit!” Shout said.\n\nShout felt the bottom of someone’s boot collide with his back, and he slammed face-first into the floor. “Care to repeat that, kid? Piece of what, now?” \n\n##green|Lieutenant Tom Peters## grit his teeth. “I said, stop hurting my wife, you dickless piece of shit.”\n\n##green|Lieutenant Tom Peters##, of some outfit in the unit popularly known as Seal Team Six, felt the pressure of someone’s foot suddenly lift off his back. ##green|Tom Peters## rolled to face its direction. ##green|Tom Peters## saw //piece of shit// stumble backwards in horror. //Piece of shit// covered its face with its hands. When it pulled them back, thick strings of amber clung to its fingers. Its eyes and nose began to seep and blend into its bubbling cheeks and forehead. “I…I…who am…what the fuck…” It warbled, struggling to force its lips to keep the waxen mass of its molten face from pouring into its mouth. Then, it never happened.\n\n##green|Tom Peters## felt someone pull him to his feet, and heard that someone shout in ##green|Tom Peters’## ear, “Lieutenant! Are you okay?”\n\n##green|Tom Peters## heard ##green|Tom Peters## reply to Nineball. “I’m good! I’m good! Get off of me! Everybody, resume clearing the hallway. Brigand, Thunder, Nineball, I heard noises in the elevator-make sure that’s Delta, and if it is, give ‘em a good holler about going off-script during a \nblack op. I’ll interrogate the HVT.”\n\n“A black op, sir?” Brigand asked.\n\n“Fucking do it.” Tom Peters screamed, and the unit scattered throughout the hallway, leaving Tom Peters and Fades were left alone.\n\nTom Peters grabbed his ears and fell to his knees. “Who am I? What is happening to me? What-”\n\nTom looked at his hands, saw Shout in Whisper’s young pianist hands, unblemished by work or toil, and his ring-finger with the smudged, three year old wedding band and the missing fingertip. Yet Tom also wondered why those same hands weren’t thirty six years old, covered with military gloves. He felt confused by the way Shout’s skinny arms lacked Tom’s creeping bear tattoo. He reached for his face, and wondered why a combat knife-trimmed beard didn’t wrap his cheeks. \n\n“Shout. Shout! God dammit. Tom! Look at me! Look at me.” She grabbed his hands and jerked them towards her.\n\nFades whispered in his ear. “Listen to me. Focus on my voice. You’re here with me, Shout. That’s what matters. You’re here with me.”\n\n“We've got to run, we've got to run…” Tom was babbling, “My name, what happened to my name-”\n\n“Tom,” She said,“Take a moment, breathe. What are you always telling me about what to do when the stage is falling apart? Say it with me now. What should we always do under pressure?”\n\nTom swallowed, and let his heart relax at a wholly unfamiliar rhythm. “Stay in character.” He and Fades both said, and the memory from a previous name rang loud in the cacophony of ontologically familiar yet ontically alien sensations, memories and notions. “Stay in character. Right. Right.”\n\n“Tom, look at me.” Fades said, pulling his head towards her, pressing her forehead on his, “We can live through this. You just have to focus.”\n\nTom nodded, and looked around the hallway, racking his brains. “Okay, I’m a spec ops commander with limitless field authority...We’ve gotta use that. So what would he do next?” Tom tried to read his instincts. “He’d…secure the HVT,” he said, “I’ve got to make this look legit.” He looked at Fades, who smirked at him, nonverbally telling him to do the math. He shook his head. “Oh fuck no.”\n\n“So, secure me.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Pick up those zip-ties, and put them on me.”\n\n“No,” Tom said, “Absolutely not.”\n\n“We’ve got to play this as it lies, Shout. And I’d rather you were putting them on me than somebody I didn’t know. Now do it.”\n\nTom groaned. He knew Fades was right, but he was profoundly uncomfortable forcibly confining Fades, regardless of what the universe was telling him he was. He pulled Tom's zip-ties from his pocket-choosing not to think about how or when he acquired zip-ties-and waited for Fades to move accordingly. \n\n“Boy, I’m not putting my hands behind my back for you.” Fades said. Tom sighed and pulled Fades’ hands behind her back, firmly, while she offered just the slightest bit of playful give so as to make him have to yank her just that much more forcefully. He grabbed each of her wrists to pull through the loops, and pulled the line to tighten them. \n\nFades chuckled, “You can pull them tighter than that.”\n\n“Oh, shut up-” Tom said\n\n“What was it you told me when we were talking about our fantasies? ‘Four hours in a CIA black-site?’,” she said, her voice had acquired a flirty, husky contralto.\n\n“Are you seriously bringing that up at a time like this?”\n\n“Are you seriously knocking my coping mechanism?”\n\n“You’re the one who’d suggested ‘militarist roleplay’. I was just spitballing” Tom protested.\n\n“Yeah, because it’s hot, and you told me on our first date you thought it was hot.”\n\n“So, why are you teasing me?”\n\n“Because it’s fun.” Fades said. Tom rolled his eyes. \n\nNineball ran over to Tom. “Sir, are you feeling okay?\n\n“Irrelevant.” Tom felt himself say. “We’ve secured the HVT, correct?”\n\n“Yes, but-”\n\n“The area’s compromised. Don’t worry, it’s my call. We’re pulling out.”\n\n“But-”\n\n“Are you going to argue with me now?” Tom said.\n\nFades failed to not laugh.\n…\n\nFades felt like she discovered the definition of insanity. \n\nThe cliché about repeating something and expecting a different result was wholly inadequate in comparison to the experience of having  one’s memories scream one thing, while the universe pulled out all the stops to tell her she was wrong. Her memories had started to tell her she was wrong. She didn’t watch someone vanish after stomping on Shout’s back. It was always Tom who had been on the floor, Tom whom she’d rescued. Tom whom she loved. The meaning of Tom was a chimerical mess. She had the weird fantasy that Tom was actually Shout, and a weird instinct of a distinct alien variety that this fiction was truer than the real before her eyes.\n\nShe was also a daughter of Foundation staff. Her imagination was synched to a wider context of a mad world where the human mind could be turned on itself or turned into something else, where ideas could be literally weaponized and kill people. There were times one had to roll with the madness until given compelling reasons not to, and faith that Tom Peters was somehow an ontological illusion masking the love of her life was a madness she chose.\n\nAccording to Tom’s watch, which Tom wasn’t wearing, and yet Fades could nonetheless read, it was Oh-Two-Hundred-Hours when the team exfiltrated Site-46. As clean-up operations continued around then, Tom recognized a scientist just as he was summarily executed by a man in a neat three-piece suit with a bald eagle on the lapel.\n\nWhen they finally took the main security elevator back to the Prudential Lobby, they found it fortified as if a major world power might invade any minute.  The building was flooded with uniforms of various outfits, and helicopters bristling with weapons buzzed around the glass ceilings and cut the dark, flare-lit bazaar with harsh spotlights. Sergeant Joe tried to stop Tom from walking out with the HVT, but Tom darkly alluded to unofficial orders and ‘sanitizing’ the situation.Joe chose not to inquire further. The rank insubordination was borderline treason, but Tom wasn’t thinking that far into a future that wasn’t even his. Other military officers and soldiers pretended Tom wasn’t there, likely because they assumed he officially wasn’t. Tom half escorted, half pulled Fades along until they made their way down the dead escalator, when he let go of her forearm. She nudged him with her shoulder, and he laced his arm with hers.\n\nPapering the dry fountains, lining the walls, covering the tour maps and thoroughly blanketing the glass and metal awning were hundreds if not thousands of pictures of children, labeled with names and ages written in marker, pen, and occasionally blood. Fades and Tom looked at each other and mouthed different phrasings of the same thought: “What the fuck were our parents keeping from us?”\n\nEven with Captain Tom Peter’s credentials and infamy, Tom was careful not to overplay his hand. He spent fifteen minutes scoping out vehicles until he found a humvee whose sole occupant was a scared-looking member of the National Guard younger than “he” was. Tom didn’t even get to the part about threatening to summarily execute him for obstructing Presidential orders before the boy immediately pulled the key out of the ignition, threw it at Tom and ran off. Tom and Fades waited until the soldier cleared the block before cackling with laughter. Tom took out his combat knife and was about to cut the zip-tie, when Fades cleared her throat. She was bored letting Tom take the lead, and she wanted to experiment with a related technique she’d come up with last week.\n\n“Are you kidding me?” Fades said, “Do you not know how to undo tactical zip-ties?”\n\n“Oh, and you do?”\n\n“Yeah,” she said, and stuck out her elbows, clenched her fists, slammed her bound fists into her belly as hard as she could and only succeeded in slamming her solar plexus and bowling herself over, falling on her butt. The world swam around her.\n\n“Did…did you miss?”\n\nFades coughed, and Tom helped pull her to her feet. “No,” she coughed, “Probably should have taken the fact a Tier One operator was using these a little more seriously. Okay, knife then.” Tom obliged and cut the binding. She ran to the driver’s side.\n\n“Seriously?!” Tom said. “I’m a ranking officer in Seal Team Six now!”\n\n “You’d get lost crossing a one-way intersection!“ Fades said.\n\nTom laughed. \"That was, like, one time two years ago, and you haven’t had any complaints since.” He affectionately patted the hood of the humvee. “Okay, I’ll convince you. First, it would be really weird for a civilian to chauffeur me around. Second, and most importantly, I’ve wanted to drive one of these since forever. I don’t care if all my fingers are missing. I’ll cradle the wheel with my goddamn elbows. I wanna drive the cool truck.”\n\n“Fine,” Fades said, and popped open the passengers’ seat, “Shit.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“The jarheads got themselves Five Guys.”\n\n“Really?” Shout said, “Look, I just saw a man get shot to death. I’m not really hungry.”\n\n“Well, I did too, and I’m hungry, so we’re hungry.” Fades crossed her arms. “You gotta feed the one brain-cell we seem to share. Now drive someplace fun.”\n\nTom hit the road, driving down  the wrong side of the deserted Huntington Avenue  until they reached  Ruggles station, parking right next to the crest of the hill on Centennial Commons and just barely resisting the urge to use the heavy military vehicle to knock over the flagpole.\n\nTo distract herself from Tom’s questionable driving and her questions about her sanity, Fades had been looking through the various compartments in the humvee. She opened the glovebox and grinned, pulling out three blunts.\n\n“I thought drug use was banned in the military?” Tom said.\n\n“Yeah well, guess things got a little crazy while we were enjoying mama Foundation’s hospitality in Site-46,” she said. She grabbed a lighter from the glovebox stash and lit the end of one of the blunts. After taking a heavy drag from it, she offered it to Tom who waved it off. She shrugged and let it smolder on the dashboard, taking a burger from the sack of sandwiches and fries.\nShe started reflecting for the first time as she took a bite, and as the adrenaline from the past forty eight hours left her body, she felt very limp, yet very volatile at the same time. Her chest felt like it was full of broken glass so each heartbeat was accompanied by a sharp pain. She felt her hands shake. She tried to force herself to take another bite of food, but a primal scream was forming somewhere deep, somewhere just above her chest, crushing her rib-cage and squeezing her belly. The scream began to claw its way out. The burger fell from her hands, her mouth felt dry, and her lips began to quiver.\n\nThen she heard a deep, wretched howling, and the scream died aborning. She twisted in her seat, so quick she felt her stiff bones pop, and saw Tom bent over the steering wheel, sobbing into the leather. “I’m…I’m sorry, Fades, I’m a total mess…we’re absolutely fucked, and I am wasting our time just going to pieces…”\n\nShe gently shushed Shout. “Hey, hey…it’s been wild. Nobody could see what we see and not lose their shit. Also, whatever wacky shit happened that caused you to steal that guy’s…whatever it is…we’ve just gotta figure out what that is.”\n\n“‘Wacky shit’?” Tom replied. “It feels like I stole that guy’s fucking soul. And what the hell happened to our names?”\n\n“What do you mean?” Fades said, “Nothing happened to our names.”\n\n“You think normal people are named “Shout in Whispers” and “Never Fades Away\"? And would this be the first time you heard of screwed memories around what our parents do for work?”\n\n“No,” she said, “I guess not.”\n\n“I fucking killed a man.”\n\n“No, Shout,” Fades said, “Our parents did,” she held Tom by his collar and pulled him close to her. “And they hurt you too. And you’re right to be fucked up by that. Do you hear me? Cry however much you need. You don’t have to make it tidy for anyone. Especially not me.”\n\n“Fuck, Fades,” Tom said, “Feels like you’re stealing my bit in this conversation. You sure you’re alright?”\n\n“Trust,” Fades said. Then Tom held Fades by the back of the neck and pulled her the rest of the way, so his lips closed in on hers. She made a sound at the back of her throat, smiled, and leaned into the kiss, climbing out of the seat and sitting on Tom’s lap. She stared into his eyes, and he tried to say something remotely flirtatious, before Fades shook her head and dove in, pinning Tom’s head against the car-seat, and enjoying the way she made his heart shake.\n\n##purple| Then Tom shoved Fades off of him, swung the car door open and crashed into the grass. He retched, dry-heaved, and then amber sap and flower petals poured from his mouth and pooled into the grass under his face. Fades jumped down next to him and screamed his name. Tom choked and fell onto his side, his arms seizing and sticking forward into a fencing response, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-8082/offset/2 and his eyes rolled back into his skull.] ##",
