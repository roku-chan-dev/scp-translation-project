Its position is to be monitored. Coastal areas are to be evacuated, and their citizens relocated a minimum of 750km inland. Should SCP-8029 begin moving toward land before the evacuations are completed, priority is to be given to the areas most likely to be affected. \n\n**Description:** SCP-8029 was the Japanese island of Kyushu, which swam into the Pacific Ocean on 08/07/2038. \n\nPreviously, SCP-8029 was believed to be a series of anomalous earthquakes affecting the island of Kyushu. Current theories suggest the earthquakes were the effects of an unknown ritual that woke SCP-8029  from its millennia-long slumber.\n\nIts morphology resembles that of the red stingray. It has an approximate wingspan and tail length of 497km and 745.5km, respectively. There are a multitude of bite marks covering its skin that do not correspond to any currently known species. A large, triangular-shaped portion along the edge of its left wing is missing, and a several-kilometer-long scar runs across the right side of its body, starting fifteen yards behind its eye. \n\nSCP-8029 is exceptionally long-lived, though its exact lifespan is unknown. As there are no records of the island of Kyushu appearing, it is believed SCP-8029 had been laying dormant near Japan since the Paleolithic period.[[footnote]]Approximately 2.5 million BCE to 10,000 BCE.[[/footnote]] Previously, it was covered in tens of meters of seafloor, dirt, and rock, giving it the appearance of an island. SCP-8029 hosted a variety of flora and fauna commonly found on the Japanese islands, including 12.65 million humans. \n\nSince departing from the seafloor near Japan, SCP-8029 has entered the Pacific Ocean. It has remained stationary on the seabed since its arrival. It can travel at speeds up to 30.23kn.\n\nSCP-8029 feeds on deep-sea fish. Consequently, the sealife surrounding SCP-8029 suddenly increases in the hours before it feeds. After feeding, the fish populations return to pre-feeding levels regardless of whether the anomalously spawned fish were consumed. Additionally, several previously unknown species of fish spawn during these events. Research is still being conducted into these species, though it is believed that they are species that went extinct and left no fossil records. \n\nCurrently, SCP-8029 does not appear hostile to humanity. It is currently 3.96km below sea level, making tests and sample gathering challenging. All tests must halt before aggravating SCP-8029, as it is likely to cause an 8029-1 event.\n\nAn SCP-8029-1 event is the destruction of coastal areas by a tsunami caused by SCP-8029 traveling within 200m of the ocean's surface. It creates waves and tsunamis that can travel several hundred kilometers inland. The furthest recorded instance reached 687km before the force dissipated to manageable levels, flooding the following fifty kilometers. \n\n**Addendum 8029-1:** In the wake of SCP-8029's disappearance into the ocean and the subsequent damage to various nations, the O5 council held an emergency meeting to discuss the event and its consequences. The following is an excerpt from the meeting:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**O5-2:** So. Anyone want to explain how we missed an entire country-sized island being a living creature?\n\n**O5-8:** That's not something you can predict, Two. And we have much more pressing matters now. Everyone would agree the destruction of Japan, minus Hokkaido, South Korea, and the majority of North Korea would be more important than the fact we missed it for so long. \n\n**O5-7:** Agreed. \n\n//<O5-7 presses a button. A video appears on the wall behind them. Several hundred people are inside a small building. Many are visibly dirty, and there is a variety of basic essentials, including clothing, food, and toiletries, as well as several places to sleep seemingly thrown about.>//\n\n**O5-7:** This is the view of just one of the shelters remaining in Hokkaido. The other twenty-three are even tighter. Any public building able to hold people short term is just as crowded. There's an extra million people on an island ill-prepared to handle them. It's been a single day, and they're already running out of food and water. \n\n//<The scene changes to show Japan. Most buildings have collapsed. The remaining buildings have roofs one to two yards above the water.>//\n\n**O5-7:** Ninety-five percent of Japan was wiped out by SCP-8029 when it left. The civilians that were on it drowned when they couldn't escape the currents, and those on mainland Japan were killed when the tsunami hit. Japan's government has all but fallen, and the survivors are in danger of starvation. To top it off, we have hundreds of thousands of records online about the island vanishing. It's reasonable to expect that millions are aware of what happened.\n\n//<A twenty-second silence follows.>//\n\n**O5-2:** So. Damage control. \n\n**O5-3:** Is there no feasible way to contain this? Widespread amnestics? Disinformation campaign? \n\n**O5-7:** We could try, but the survivors of several Yakuza groups from the area have been leaking information that backs up the witnesses. Information from our databases. Even if we wanted to, I doubt we could suppress it entirely. \n\n**O5-2:** Who stole it? And how?\n\n**O5-9:** We're looking into it, Two. But right now, we have a bigger problem. \n\n//<Five seconds of silence pass.>//\n\n**O5-9:** We've already received word that several irate government officials aware of the anomalous are attempting to track us down. We're going to have to figure out our response and set up a meeting.  \n\n**O5-2:** Agreed. Eleven, Twelve. Would the two of you work on planning and formatting our response? \n\n//<O5-11 and O5-12 both nod.>//\n\n//<O5-13 receives a message. Fifteen seconds pass in silence before O5-13 addresses the room.>//\n\n**O5-13:** The good news is we've located SCP-8029. Apparently, it's settled for the time out in the middle of the ocean. The bad news is that while we have more information on its particular species, we need a way to contain it properly.\n\n**O5-4:** Species? \n\n**O5-13:** According to the report received from Site-250, SCP-8029 is classified as a yokai known as \"Akaei.\" They're currently looking deeper into it but don't have an idea of containment. //<O5-13 takes a moment to consider.>// Six. You're familiar with the containment specialists. Mind sending them their newest task?\n\n//<O5-6 nods.>//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nShortly after the meeting, the following note arrived at Site-250.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nYou know, little researcher? I think you'll enjoy the world I dream of. It may not be the one you humans want, but it is the only one that will bring us into an era of peace.\n\nJust imagine. Yokai and humans living together as they did long ago. But why stop there? Why should we be the only ones to experience this? I'm sure there are many creatures of the night just waiting for their time in the sun.\n\nI do hope you'll find me soon.\n\n[[=]]\nSincerely, A Friend\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAll personnel have been placed on high alert due to the potential of widespread anomalous terror attacks. Available Agents and MTF teams are to monitor and report on any possible congregation of anomalous figures. Any congregations located are to be captured and disrupted promptly.\n\n**Addendum 8029-2:** The following footage was recorded during a World Leaders Summit in an undisclosed location in the Siberian wilderness. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Note:** Both O5-11 and O5-12 attended the summit via video chat, which concealed their appearance and voices. As the summit was nearly fifteen hours long, only the most relevant parts were recorded here. See document 8029-BMO5-2038 for the full transcript. Additionally, except for O5-11 and O5-12, the various leaders will be referred to by their country of origin. \n\n-----\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n**O5-11:** As was explained three hours ago, the Foundation has done more to protect humanity than anyone will ever know, Prime Minister. Just because you haven't seen or heard of us does not mean we're some 'useless shadow puppets just here to make a quick buck.'\n\n**P.M.India:** Really now? Then how do you explain the leviathan that vanished into the sea, causing destruction in its wake? \n\n**S.L.N.Korea:** That thing destroyed my country! Not to mention the burden placed on the survivors! We won't survive the next month without help! I demand reparations! What about South Korea? Japan? What are you going to do about them?\n\n**P.Russia:** Not to mention the untold number of creatures and items you hold in secret. Tell me, how many times have they breached containment? How can we be sure you can even contain this one? That thing is the size of a small country.\n\n**O5-12:** Our specialists are working on a solution as we speak. Until then, we've decided the safest course for everyone is to evacuate coastal areas. Yes, it'll place a heavy burden on the rest of the world, but it's better than losing several hundreds of millions of civilians, wouldn't you agree? \n\n//<Silence falls over the assembled group for ten seconds.>//\n\n**O5-11:** We know this isn't a great solution, but until we figure out how to contain the anomaly, you'll have to trust that this is the best course of action.\n\n**P.U.S.A.:** Why contain it at all? Why not just kill the beast and be done?\n\n**O5-12:** We are not in the business of neutralizing anomalies, let alone for mere convenience. Is there anything meaningful that you want to add to this discussion? \n\n**P.M.India:** How are you planning on fulfilling reparations? As I see it, this is all your fault -- you and your organization! So, how are you going to fix this?\n\n**O5-11:** We're already sending relief and aid to Hokkaido as well as several relief camps in Korea. We're also preparing support for other nations directly affected by this anomaly. \n\n//<The following two hours were removed for brevity.>//\n\n**O5-12:** Tempers are high. I suggest we take a break and return to this in an hour.\n\n//<A series of disgruntled grumbles are heard. However, no one objects. The room empties within minutes.>//\n\n**O5-11:** I would comment on their irrationality if it wouldn't drag this out for another six hours.\n\n**O5-12:** I'd love to put them in their places, but One wants this to go as smoothly as possible.\n\n//<Both O5's sigh. Someone rushes in only to stop before the computer hosting O5-12.>//\n\n**Unknown Agent:** Sirs! \n\n**O5-12:** Commander. Something to report?\n\n**Unknown Agent:** Hokkaido's begun moving, Sirs. As has 8029. It's heading for China. We think Hokkaido's going to try and rendezvous with it.\n\n//<There is silence for fifteen seconds before the door opens. Germany's representative walks in. His form begins to shift.>//\n\n**Unknown:** Oh? Did I miss the party? I thought for sure I was on time, considering all those nasty politicians milling about out there.\n\n**O5-11:** Who are you? How did you get in here?\n\n**Unknown:** I thought that would be obvious by now. Or are you Hunters dumber than the grunts gave you credit for?  //<A sound of disapproval is heard.>// I knew I should have kept my conversations with that little researcher. You're so dull. That's not a good look for someone in charge.\n\n**O5-12:** What do you want?\n\n**Unknown:** Finally, a sensible question. What I want is to talk. Nothing more. Would you mind calling back those politicians? I have something they'd like to hear. A few of them know about yokai and the like, yes?\n\n//<The unknown man sits on the table between the computers hosting O5-11 and O5-12. Thirty-two minutes pass before those attending have regrouped in the room.>//\n\n**Unknown:** Now that everyone's here, I have something to say. Oh! But first--\n\n//<The man's face changes, and he grows ears and a tail resembling a raccoon dog. As this occurs, several live feeds worldwide are seized, showing a feed of the meeting room.[[footnote]]It is unknown how this was organized.[[/footnote]] O5-11 and O5-12 can be heard muttering to someone to shut it off.>//\n\n**Unknown:** Much better. Now. I am Aka.[[footnote]]PoI 712-1. The one-time leader of GoI-712, The Yokai Hunters.[[/footnote]] Our shadow friends here gave me some numerical designation, but I never cared to remember it. Anyway! As our shadowy friends here know, I've just sent a pair of akaei to your mainland. They were so bored, sleeping like that for so long while you built your cities atop them. You know, fishermen used to give a portion of their catch to honor them. I wonder if you even remembered they were there. Do you ever stop to think about what's around you? Under you? Above you, even?\n\n//<PoI 712-1 pauses for a few seconds. O5-12 can be heard demanding the feed be cut.>//\n\n**PoI 712-1:** These shadow-clad leaders don't know a lot of things despite their vast array of forbidden knowledge. You see, my friends carry as many yokai, spooks, and other supernatural beings as I could find in the last twenty years. This is just the first step. Soon, all your silly little countries will remember that myths have their bases in reality.\n\n**PoI 712-1:** These Hunters, hiding in the shadows, thought they were brilliant, protecting humanity as they have. You've forgotten about those of us that go bump in the night. There's no longer a reason for you to fear the unknown. It's made you weak.\n\n**PoI 712-1:** Don't worry. I'm simply doing you the favor these Hunters refuse. I'm letting humanity remember why we need peace and coexistence.\n\n//<Five seconds pass before PoI 712-1 continues.>//\n\n**PoI 712-1:** It's war, my friends.\n\n//<PoI 712-1 transforms into an insect, illuding capture. The crowd is in an uproar. The worldwide feed cuts off.>//\n\n**P.U.S.A.:** This is an outrage! How could you let him just leave like that!?\n\n**O5-12:** Do you currently have a way to capture a fly without fail? I can assure you no one else here does.\n\n//<Silence falls over the room.>//\n\n**O5-12:** I thought not. Now, I believe the first thing we should do is discuss our responses to this threat.\n\n**P.U.S.A.:** Simple. Neutralize the threats. We could nuke the fish without ever endangering a single soldier. That shapeshifter will be more challenging, but I don't see why we couldn't do the same thing once we find it.\n\n**P.M.India:** Excuse you? You're willing to nuke another country to solve this issue? What of the civilians?\n\n**P.U.S.A.:** And? Your people are none of my business.\n\n**P.M.Canada:** For the record, I think it's worth considering. This 'Aka' is clearly willing to start a supernatural war. Who's to say what he'll do to win it?\n\n//<The government officials descend into arguments. Above the chatter, a ringing phone can be heard. The noise dies down as the call begins.>//\n\n//<The Chinese official speaks into the phone. He sounds worried. After a moment, he drops into his chair and frantically types something into his laptop.>//\n\n//<The screen turns on behind the laptops hosting O5-11 and O5-12. It is a video from a skyscraper in Shanghai. The feed is facing the ocean. In the distance, SCP-8029 can be seen behind a building wave.>//\n\n//<China's official slides out of his chair and lands on the floor. He mutters something under his breath. A sheen of sweat can be seen on his face.>//\n\n//<The wave builds until it's over thirty meters high. Screams are heard from the streets. Water crashes into the city. Several buildings fall as the camera shakes. A scream comes from behind the camera, and the phone falls a short distance. It's angled strangely but still has a view of the scene unfolding in the city.>//\n\n//<Water crashes into the building the camera's in. Distorted images flash by for thirty seconds before the feed cuts off.>//\n\n//<Several officials tend to the man on the floor.>//\n\n//<The screen changes. A live feed from a news helicopter plays on screen.>//\n\n//<Buildings crash down under the water. Cries are heard from thousands before being muffled. Several dozen people jump from skyscrapers.>//\n\n//<In the distance, SCP-8029 reaches shore. A multitude of shadows scatter from its back. A flock of birds races towards the helicopter. They do not stop as they reach it, aiming for the spinning blades.>//\n\n//<The blades stop, one breaks off, and the helicopter falls. It's in the rushing water after twenty seconds. The feed cuts out two seconds before the screen turns off.>//\n\n//<The room is silent for two minutes. O5-11 and O5-12 can be heard quietly conversing.>//\n\n**P.M.India:** //<To O5-11:>// So. How did you want to go about solving this?\n\n**O5-11:** We are currently preparing to send as many task forces as possible to deal with the threat; however, there is a good chance it won't be enough. We have numerous anomalies that require their attention, and the public must remain safe.\n\n**S.L.N.Korea:** You want our help. //<A bitter chuckle.>// You. The all-powerful shadow military. Want our help? What could we possibly offer you? I can't imagine there's anything normal armies can do against superstition and legend.\n\n**O5-12:** Just because you don't know about the things we keep in the shadows does not mean it's wise to disregard the might of the world's militaries. We are currently forming a plan. We--\n\n**P.U.S.A.:** You're forming it!? What about the rest of us? The representative of China is very nearly comatose from the shock!\n\n**P.M.Canada:** We should have some say in how our militaries are used! I'm not going to let some unknown players sit here and dictate what I can and can't do!\n\n**O5-11:** When we said we were coming up with a plan, we meant that we were going to come up with an overview. Something on this scale needs organization. That's not going to happen if all of you go off making decisions on your own.\n\n//<An argument begins. The following hour was cut for brevity.>//\n\n**O5-11:** Yes, ambassador. We understand you had family in Shanghai. Yelling at us will not bring them back. Now, if you're all finished, we'd like to discuss where to go from here.\n\n//<Disgruntled murmurs of acceptance are heard.>//\n\n**O5-12:** Good. Now. We've contacted the leadership of several groups who can be of assistance. They've agreed to help retake Shanghai and protect any countries that look to be in danger of invasion by this anomalous force. What we need is--\n\n**P.Russia:** Now, hold on. How do we know you don't control these groups you're talking about? For all we know, they're just an extension of your organization.\n\n**P.U.S.A.:** Besides, we haven't even decided whether to destroy those things yet!\n\n**O5-11:** We don't--\n\n**P.U.S.A.:** Yeah, yeah. We know. Your stupid shadow group doesn't kill things. We get it. Now! Who's in favor of making those things regret being born?\n\n//<Thirty-seven hands raise.>//\n\n**O5-12:** Before we resort to genocide, why don't we figure out our plan of attack? If this war can be won without slaughtering every anomaly along our path, I believe that will benefit us all.\n\n**O5-11:** We're assigning our task forces to aid in commanding your armies and rescue. If you want your countries to survive, we recommend you listen to them.\n\n**P.M.India:** Now we're fighting a war for you?\n\n//<Both O5 members sigh heavily.>//\n\n**O5-11:** Let's put the matter to a vote. If the majority agrees, we will move into planning our retaliation.\n\n//<Murmers of agreement spread throughout the crowd.>//\n\n**O5-12:** On each of your computers, you'll find the vote. Simply hit yes or no, and we should have our answer in a few minutes.\n\n||||= War? ||\n|| Yes || No ||\n||= X ||   ||\n||   ||= X ||\n||= X  ||   ||\n||= X ||   ||\n||   ||= X ||\n[[=]]\n//<Two hundred votes were redacted for brevity.>//\n[[/=]]\n\n**O5-11:** 175 for, 22 against. It's war, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the vote, the next several days were spent planning. During this time, members of various GoI, paramilitary organizations, and freelance militias, including the Horizon Initiative and the Global Occult Coalition, held their ground. Any remaining buildings have fallen to ruin. Bombings of the anomaly-laden areas have been enacted, though many of the anomalous creatures have survived. Despite massive losses on both sides, including a large number of Foundation agents, the anomalous attack on Shanghai has yet to breach the city limits.\n\nAll available Foundation personnel are to prepare for combat and relief efforts. Memos have been sent to each Site. All MTFs, Agents, and other combat-ready personnel not currently engaged in containment will be transferred as necessary.  \n\nEfforts to locate PoI 712-1 have failed. Attempts to locate and capture PoI 712-1 are top priorities, and all necessary resources will be available.",
