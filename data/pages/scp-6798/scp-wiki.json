Should further instances of SCP-6798 be discovered, they are to be contained similarly. The location of the remaining 4 known SCP-6798 instances is of B class priority.\n\nResearch and treatment of SCP-6798 are to be handled by the Department of Oral Hygiene. All Foundation personnel are required to be checked for SCP-6798 presence before going through involved dental procedures.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6798 refers to a molar-shaped object found in the place of Foundation Dr Harriet Erskine’s lower mandibular second molar. The composition of SCP-6798 is primarily of hydroxyapatite, while its surface is coated in a layer of calcium phosphate. This coating layer significantly increases resistance to blunt force. SCP-6798 will remain inactive until sustained contact with human saliva.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Periodontitis_Crónica_Severa.JPG|caption=Gingival recession and Inflammation caused by SCP-6798-1]]\n\nWithin 50 hours of sustained contact with saliva, SCP-6798 will begin to secrete an acidic fluid designated SCP-6798-1. SCP-6798-1 causes formations of cavities; bleeding, swelling, inflammation of the gums and formation of spike-like structures, designated SCP-6798-2, from the pulp. Major dental pain lasts approximately one day after the initial infection. This is hypothesised to be the result of SCP-6798-1’s contact with nerval tissue, causing neurotmesis. In most cases, the affected individual permanently suffers from loss of motor control of the masticatory muscles and is accompanied by excessive gingival bleeding and other periodontal diseases.\n\nSCP-6798-2 will extend from the mandible or the maxilla and will continue to grow until the expiration of the subject, primarily through SCP-6798-2 piercing the brain. At this stage, due to the destruction of the mandibular or the maxillary nerve through nerval contact with SCP-6798-1, the subject will not sense any pain.\n\nAs of writing, the cure to SCP-6798, alongside possibilities to revert the spike growth, is yet to be discovered. However, maintaining proper dental care and frequent usage of oral irrigators are proven to reduce the amount of SCP-6798-1 secreted.\n\n**Addendum-1:** \n\nThe existence of SCP-6798 was first discovered on 05/08/2020. Dr Harriet Erskine reported an abnormal amount of dental pain after tooth extraction surgery. 64 hours after the operation, she was sent to the site emergency room after falling unconscious during a department meeting session, believed to have been caused by SCP-6798 piercing her brain. Dr Erskine was declared deceased on 06/08/2020.\n\nRecords show that the dental extraction surgery was conducted by a dentist under the name of \"Dr Holland\". No records or memory of the existence of Dr Holland exists in the Department of Oral Hygiene. Until the time of writing, no further SCP-6798 instances are found.\n\n**Addendum-2:** Interview with Dr Liza Taylor\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Open Interview Log\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Dr Liza Taylor, Director of Research of the Department of Oral Hygiene\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr Tom Neumann, Assistant Director of Department and Facility\n \n**Foreword:** Dr Taylor requested to meet with Dr Neumann on 17/08/2020, regarding the origins of SCP-6798.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Taylor:** Tom, just before we start, I just want to say that I’m so sorry for what happened to Harriet. She was a lovely person.\n\n**Neumann:** I appreciate it. \n\n**Taylor:** So I think I owe it to her to say I created SCP-6798. Most likely.\n\n**Neumann:** \"Most likely?\" What do you mean?\n\n**Taylor:** A while back I got orders to work on a project from Site-17. They wanted me to work on something like an implant, save time from toothbrushing, flossing and cleaning teeth each day.\n\n**Neumann:**  Is four minutes a day really that hard for them?\n\n**Taylor:** I didn’t ask. The experiment sounded like fun. My idea was to create this dental care device in the shape of a molar so that it would look more natural. I had about 5 more-or-less working prototypes. The concept behind the prototypes is that it converts saliva into something like a dental sealant that prevents the formation of calculus or the development of cavities. The details are not too interesting. Here's the summarised report on my project, you can read it if you're interested...\n\n(//Dr Taylor lays an envelope on the table and pushes it to Dr Neumann. Dr Neumann opens the envelope and lakes out a piece of paper//)\n\n**Neumann:** Seems like there're problems with the \"cleaning fluid\"? \"Cleaning fluid causes crystallisation of the gums\". What does that mean? It seems to be causing lots of trouble.\n\n**Taylor:** About that, it was one of the most important parts of the project. I can tell you that it reacts with saliva and creates a fluid that removes bacteria. Don't know why, but it always seemed to cause the formation of small crystals in the mouth that causes damage to the mouth.\n\n**Neumann:** Why don't you use something else then?\n\n**Taylor:** With that thing, the cleaning fluid doesn't have to be replaced every day. I can get rid of the crystallisation if I tweak it enough.\n\n**Neumann:** So how did this little project of yours kill my secretary?\n\n**Taylor:** I have no idea. Not to sound paranoid, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-typical-visit-to-the-dentist but I wonder if someone here is not who they claim]. But I would like to perform a secondary autopsy on Erskine. Can you maybe let me cut her open? I want to see what exactly causes this effect and maybe prevent it from happening with the final product.\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** Following the interview, the SCP-6798 sample on the mandible of Dr Erskine was removed and studied. Analysis of the sample shows alterations from the original blueprints of Dr Taylor. The location of the three SCP-6798 instances is yet to be determined.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6797]]] | SCP-6798 | [[[SCP-6799]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Dental_X-rays.JPG\n> **Name:** Dental X-rays\n> **Author:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Dmitry_G Dmitry G]\n> **License:** Public domain \n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dental_X-rays.JPG|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Periodontitis_Crónica_Severa.JPG\n> **Name:** Periodontitis Crónica Severa\n> **Author:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Zeron Zeron]\n> **License:** Public domain \n> **Source Link:** [[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Periodontitis_Crónica_Severa.JPG|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
