It's Dr. Michaud's experimental sidearm.]\n\n**Conseil:** That is a gun. Analysis: a //boring// gun.\n\n**Kenny:** What does it do?\n\n**Conseil:** It goes bang. Let's move on --\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Specifically, it goes \"BWAANGSCH\" and shorts out a small city as collateral damage from a single compressed-energy round. That's the BELUGA-57A Automjollnir.

Uh... listen, buddy, we got a whole room dedicated to shooting off guns and blowing stuff up! It's called the firing range! Wanna see it?\n\n**Conseil:** NAX!\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** That was a rhetorical question! Because I can guarantee that you DO NOT wanna see the firing range. Boring as hell!

Is something wrong?\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Eh, not really, just... thinkin'. About Kenny.\n\n**Conseil:** I'm sorry I wasn't able to repel him effectively.\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Actually, I'm starting to think this might be a blessing in disguise.\n\n[Conseil turns around, staring at her wall monitor.]\n\n**Conseil:** Requesting clarification.\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Well... does he really ask for much from us? He doesn't have any huge plans that could get in the way of our time together. As far as I can tell, he just wants to play with the old Master's guns. And so long as we hide from him all the nuclear-level stuff that could potentially destroy Site-BELUGA -- well, sooner or later, he //will// get bored.\n\n**Conseil:** ...interesting.\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Yeah?\n\n**Conseil:** Analysis: I'm starting to see why Michaud kept you around for so long.\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Well... what's the verdict on //you// keeping me around?\n\n**Conseil:** Forever.\n\n[An armature behind the monitor presses the top of the screen against Conseil's forehead.]\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Damn right.\n\n**Kenny:** Okay, I'm done.\n\n[Conseil quickly turns to face him.]\n\n**Conseil:** Excellent work, Master.\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Hell yeah!

We don't transfer Kenny's mind anywhere. We just take knowledge from our databanks, just as much as he'll need to breeze right through grade school -- and upload it to his mind!\n\n**Kenny:** Sounds great. Let's do it.\n\n**Conseil:** Counterpoint: his brain's still growing!

Is this gonna hurt?\n\n**Conseil:** Counterpoint: what will hurt more? Mild pain followed by success, or your parents discovering your continued failure at a later date, and in doing so, having you forcibly disassembled and recycling your parts for surveyor drones?\n\n**Kenny:** WHAT?!\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** [[size 75%]]//(Consey, he's a human.

We can find a solution to satisfy both parties.\n\n[She touches Kenny on the shoulder. He recoils from her touch in fear.]\n\n**Kenny:** //That wasn't me touching her she touched me I swear!//\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Don't tell me I traumatized him!\n\n**HyperDude:** Proposal: What if I met you in the middle, Master? I could go to this science fair with you, show off, then I come right back here -- and in exchange, you could take this gun off and build me a new arm. \n\nPrognosis: By then, with your intellect fully recognized by the public -- then if your mother and father //still// aren't paying attention to you, that's on //them.//\n\nHow does that sound?\n\n**Kenny:** //I-I mean... that's fair, I guess..//\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** Heh, yeah. Let's be honest: she'd make a terrible superhero anyway. She's too cute.\n\n[Kenny stands up. He wipes his face with his sleeve.]\n\n**Kenny:** ...I'm gonna go watch Scooby Doo or something. Titties: when I get back, compile a list of ways I could treat you both better.\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** //[Tiny gasp.]//\n\n**Kenny:** I'm really sorry for how I've acted. I've never had friends who have stuck around with me for this long, so I could use some advice.\n\n**HyperDude:** **{{[ACKNOWLEDGED.]}}**\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** ...\n\n**HyperDude:** Nax?\n\n**ARONNAX.AIC:** ...//[Gross sobbing with joy.]// **{{[ACKNOWLEDGED WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE.]}}** \n[[/div]]\n------\n+++++ D/PACKET/TESTIMONIAL/SCIENCEFAIR.MOV\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #000000;background #ffffff; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top:10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ **October 20th, 1998**\n[[/=]]\n[Conseil stands at a table in a school gymnasium. Kenny is beside her. Echoing children's voices sound throughout the room. Judges in business suits pass occasionally, glancing at her with skepticism.]\n\n[A young girl stares at Conseil. Conseil waves.]\n\n**HyperDude:** Beep boop. Hello, small child. I am UltraMegaHyperDude the Nuclear Death Cop. I am a robot. \n\n**Kenny:** He's a real robot, y'know! I built him all by myself. No big deal.\n\n[The girl continues staring blankly for about ten seconds -- then turns to Kenny.]\n\n**Girl:** What school are you from?\n\n**Kenny:** Gleeson Elementary!\n\n**Girl:** I thought the winners of the Gleeson science fair was on the other side of the gym.\n\n**Kenny:** What? I didn't win any science fairs. Not yet. That's why I'm here! Can't win if you don't play, am I right?\n\n**Girl:** That's weird.\n\n**Kenny:** Yeah yeah yeah, but is it as weird as //a freakin' robot?//\n\n**Girl:** But you had to win at your own school first in order to have a table here.\n\n**HyperDude:** Proposal: discontinue ignoring how cool I am, small child.\n\n**Girl:** Where's your presentation board?\n\n**Kenny:** Where's your //robot?!//\n\n[The girl runs away, trying not to cry.]\n\n**HyperDude:** Analysis: treating the impressionable public combatively will not do your publicity any favors.\n\n**Kenny:** Yeah, yeah. But she had it out for me.\n\n[A boy approaches from the side, carrying a presentation board and a cardboard box.]\n\n**Boy:** Um. Excuse me.\n\n**HyperDude:** Beep Boop. Hello, small child, I am--\n\n**Boy:** This is table 46, right?\n\n**Kenny:** I dunno, but it was empty. But that's not important. Check out my robot!\n\n[The boy checks the side of the table.]\n\n**Boy:** Yeah, 46. This is my table. Excuse me.\n\n[The boy tries to set up his presentation board.]\n\n**Kenny:** H-hey! What gives?! You're blocking my robot!\n\n**Boy:** Take your robot somewhere else. 46 is my table.\n\n**Kenny:** Bullshit, who said so?!\n\n**Boy:** Uh, the DuPage County school board? The judges? Everyone who can read a third-grade level and saw the directory? Get lost. You don't even have a presentation board.\n\n**HyperDude:** Proposal: we should move to a different --\n\n**Kenny:** Oh, //I'm sorry//, did I miss the fucking memo where the collective zeitgeist of everyone but myself decided that presentation boards were objectively cooler than A FUCKING ROBOT?!\n\n[His voice echoes. Total silence surrounds him.]\n\nWhat's your ridiculous project even about?! What could you produce that's so lofty in the hierarchy of knowledge that it can cast its gaze downward?!\n\n[Conseil and Kenny walk around to see the presentation board. The project is titled \"HOW MUCH WEIGHT CAN BE LIFTED BY MY ROBOT ARM? BY ANTHONY MANKIEWICZ.\" It comes with a working carboard model constructed by Anthony of a robotic arm, movable through the use of twine, pulleys, and winches.]\n\n[Kenny shivers with rage.]\n\n--**Boy**-- **Anthony:** It's a robot arm. It lifts stuff. Like bottlecaps!\n\n**HyperDude:** Analysis: Anthony's understanding of mechanical principle is quite solid. Prognosis: if you two collaborated, my motor efficiency could be improved by 27%.\n\n**Kenny:** That is NOT a ROBOT! THAT IS A GLORIFIED //PUPPET!//\n\n[Laughter from the surrounding exhibits.]\n\n**HyperDude:** Proposal: I would advise against saying \"stop laughing at me.\"\n\n**Anthony:** Stay away from my table, jackass. Some of us actually have to //make// our projects. Not everyone has parents who can afford whatever the hell kinda toy that is.\n\n[Laughter intensifies.]\n\n...\n\n[Kenny closes his eyes.]\n\n[He takes a deep breath.]\n\n...\n\n**Kenny:** ...Titties: attack.\n\n[Conseil raises SCP-8922-A at Anthony. It starts spinning and charging.]\n\n**HyperDude:** **{{[ACKNOWLEDGED.]}}** //LOADING 0.01% ABSOLUTE MINIMUM POWER DIFFERENTIAL EVACUATE RUN ESCAPE PLEASE I'M SORRY I'M SO SORRY I'M --//\n\n[Flash of light.]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n> //\"...at this time, authorities are still looking into the cause of the sudden fire that destroyed Sandburg Elementary's gymnasium.
