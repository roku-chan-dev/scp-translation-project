This persists into the courtyard, with the only exception being an antechamber at the back of the facility, which gives way to an opening into the main complex of the anomaly.\n\nInside, SCP-8090 opens into a palatial foyer (See Fig 1.1) consisting of three layers leading into an elaborate series of rooms, chambers, and hallways. Most of the aforementioned spaces are decorated with vast displays of artwork and artifacts lining the walls and ceilings depicting the mythical icons of GOI-850, as well as a significant amount of anomalous history[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]An extensive amount of the past that has ties to or can be explained through the anomalous, much of which has been either lost or intentionally forgotten.[[/span]]. This area demonstrates non-Euclidean geometry as its interior dimensions exceed far beyond those of its exterior, pending proper measurement.\n\nSome subjects of interest within SCP-8090's complex are a collection of three chambers, labeled SCP-8090-A, SCP-8090-B, and SCP-8090-C, which refer to a labyrinth, a tower seven hundred meters in height, and an artificial outside field, respectively. //[See Addendum 8090.2 for more information]//\n\n[[div class=\"floatbox right\"]]\n**SCP-3580:** Female humanoid entity capable of minor yet rapid acts of thaumaturgy as well as excessive violence.

Utilizing their anomalous capabilities, they have engaged in multiple and repeated acts of theft, murder, and terrorism across an international scope.  \n\nGOI-850 acts as an international clandestine organization operating with very few members. Despite this, however, it is capable of orchestrating conspiracies in its search for artifacts related to its sacred figure. It stores these relics within SCP-8090, creating new displays for each recovered item.\n\nFrom what has been gathered, it is believed that GOI-850 worships a mythical figure known as Archine - one of the very first human beings, as well as a valiant hero and brilliant tactician - and has gone to great effort to advance the capabilities of its followers - like the iconic figure - to an unknown end.\n\nAt present, eighteen confirmed instances of these enhanced humanoids - referred to as \"knights\" by the Order - are contained. Each of these entities shows extraordinary physical capabilities and or thaumaturgic prowess, making them extraordinarily dangerous, as well as useful for the group.\n\nThe leader of this group is among these augmented humanoids. Referred to as the \"Apex Monarch\" (POI-8090-1), it is believed to be the oldest living member of GOI-850, acting as both its commander and religious head.\n\nNotably, SCP-8090 was originally located in Europe and acted as GOI-850's sole facility. This was changed following the Foundation failing in its first attempt at containing it, after which GOI-850 managed to thaumaturgically transport the entirety of SCP-8090 to its present location in New Zealand.\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**17:09:** //The humanoids shout at the agents in English and French.

He points the shotgun upward and shoots at the humanoid's head. Racking the shotgun, he repeats the process until he runs out of ammo. The entity's head is shredded, terminating it and sending it to the floor.//\n\n**GOI-850/1:** No, no! No!\n\n**Cpt.

Michaels, Vega, and DeMarcus join with their teams and move deeper into the facility down four separate halls. Two agents from Beta-777 accompany Roufhous as they walk up the stairs and into the central hallway.

These accounts were spread out over several months and separate locations, however, they were consistent in their descriptions of the figure and its accomplice.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Larger than a single-story house, dressed in dark black armor, glowing green eyes, and with a \"witch child\" in tow.[[/span]]\n\n**1794:** Records of this same entity begin appearing across the ocean in France. The string of these accounts shows the humanoid having landed at Nouvelle-Aquitaine as it made its way westward towards Grand Est before leaving the country.\n\n**1808:** After following the trail of the entity's attacks to its home base, Foundation forces launch an assault on LOI-850 (\"Yhiloyehyra\"). GOI-850's leadership is severely crippled but manages to escape. LOI-850 disappears along with them.\n\nBecause of the numerous potential threats observed during this operation in conjunction with the location's relocation, Project Labyrinth was conceived to track down and contain GOI-850.\n\n**1968-1970:** The Federal Bureau of Investigation begins a two-year-long series of inquiries into international shipping agent Kevin Gibson under suspicions of communist affiliations. During a raid on a freighter operated by Gibson, containers were found carrying an unknown number of missing persons.\n\nDuring this operation, Gibson had been captured and the cargo ship was seized. This was until one GOI-850 member was found on the ship, which then proceeded to terminate all but three federal officers on board, leading to Gibson escaping with the ship's cargo. The officers' testimonies proved vital to linking Gibson to GOI-850, and Gibson was subsequently designated as POI-9112.\n\n[[div class=\"floatbox right\"]]\n**SCP-3580-A:** Humanoid knight entity, four meters in height equipped with a Gatling gun on its left arm. Presently terminated.\n[[/div]]\n\n**1971:** SCP-3580 attacks Site-41, killing fourteen personnel, obtaining confidential Foundation information, and terminating the Site's Director Malkin Fallen.\n\nThe Foundation locates POI-9112 and attempts to capture him. This endeavor failed, as a member of GOI-850, later designated SCP-3580-A, intervened, killing all but Agent Mortimer Woodlock out of the Mobile Task Force agents responsible for the operation as well as POI-9112.\n\n**1978:** SCP-3580 attacks Site-102, executing twelve personnel in the process, and discovers the location of Area-55 - the main base of Project Labyrinth. Later, the same entity intercepts an armored van escort delivering one POI-1492, killing four Foundation personnel and escaping with POI-1492.\n\n**1979:** SCP-3580, joined later by SCP-3580-A, attacks Area-55, killing five personnel and stealing half of a parchment detailing the thaumaturgic incantation previously used to teleport SCP-8090.\n\nOne week later, SCP-3580 and SCP-3580-A utilized that incantation to transport the Bagger 288 excavator from Germany to Turkey. Four teams of Mobile Task Force operatives from Nu-7 were deployed and engaged the two entities.\n\nThe event ended with SCP-3580-A being terminated, an as-of-yet unknown cost in damages to Foundation equipment, the Bagger 288 being severely damaged, SCP-3580 escaping, rising tensions between Germany and Turkey, and a total of sixteen agents killed in action.\n\nFour days after this event, an email was sent to all Project Labyrinth personnel from a terminal in New Zealand. After 26 hours of organizing, Nu-7 was deployed and led a campaign to contain LOI-850 - later redesignated as SCP-8090.\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n= [[size 150%]]__**Addenda: 8090.2/Layout**__[[/size]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n**Lobby:** The central foyer measures eighteen meters in width, thirty-one meters in length, and twenty-eight meters in height. Above, there is a split mural, depicting GOI-850's icon Archine defeating Alnilam, a large raven-like creature multiple times her size. The other then shows her imprisoning it in a cage. In both, Archine stands proud, holding a blazing sword overhead atop a shameful Alnilam.\n\nThe lobby then connects to nine separate passageways connecting to SCP-8090-A, SCP-8090-B, SCP-8090-C, a lush garden, five chambers for training activities, a vast weapons arsenal, six stores of anomalous artifacts, as well as personal accommodations for most of GOI-850's members.\n----\n**SCP-8090-B:** Located at the westernmost end of the second floor, entering through this hallway leads into a massive corridor, each end connected by a series of catwalks situated 1.4 kilometers above the ground. At the bottom, there is a mound of corpses comprised exclusively of failed GOI-850 knight entities (SCP-8090-A1).\n\nAt the other end of this chamber, the bridge expands to accommodate a spiraling staircase spire extending 700 meters into the air. Alcoves are situated all along the walls, acting as stores for a consistently similar series of artifacts, as well as a collection of displays detailing a species of four armed humanoid entities engaging in acts of warfare utilizing advanced thaumaturgy.\n\nAt the top of the tower is a miniature garden with a constantly flowing fountain in its center. At the base of this structure is a string of text, glowing with a bright yellow light, that appears to visually automatically translate into the reader's primary language. The text reads:\n[[=]]\n> A gift to serve\n> But not tragic\n> I cannot thank you\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n**17:15:** //Entering the hallway, operatives overhear a loud, echoing sound from within the chamber.

The sky is heavily clouded, and distant shouting can be heard. To the north, hundreds of large chunks of rock can be seen floating in the sky, smoke rising from many of them. Upon closer examination, fortresses can be observed inside and above these parts, which crumble, and slowly rotate around a central vertical palace.\n\nExplosions, thunder, and a distant roaring can be heard as well. In the clouds, there are occasional flashes of dark red and orange light, and a silhouette of a massive winged creature can be seen.\n\nAfter eighteen minutes, the city begins to fall and soon after collides with the ground. The beast makes one final dive overhead from the subject, briefly coming into view and revealing a black hide before drifting back above the clouds. Sometime later, an army is seen moving out from the ruins of the city bearing banners like the ones observed in SCP-8090-B.\n\nSuddenly, the ground erupts. Crackling can be heard all around, capable of causing temporary hearing damage in subjects, as mounds begin to form on the Earth. Hume levels visibly begin to rise lie heat distortion as those mounds escalate and grow into mountains and reach further and further into the sky, each of them situated around the army. Glowing blue light emerges from the group as the mountains become kilometers tall, and begin to arch towards one another.\n\nAt twenty-four minutes, the mountains fall into one another, converging upon the group. A violent shockwave is felt, and the vision ends as the crashing mountains obscure the legion.\n\nThe room then returns to baseline - a small chamber with only a podium and its item as its features. Atop the stand is a spear, well out of human proportion and inscribed with the following:\n[[=]]\n> Be proud, not mourning.\n> His price paid, our battle won.\n> Be free but warned.

Given the severity of the humanoid anomalies being contained, it was decided that one facility would be dedicated to holding the captured members of GOI-850 and the other for housing faculty.\n\nThree days after their arrival, interrogations began with the POIs to learn more about the group, its functions, the missing persons, and SCP-8090 itself.

Divinity is not above humanity. Divinity too may die.\n\nThese are the core beliefs of GOI-850. That humanity is separate from the divine, and should not be made to serve them. As put forth by Archine herself when she brought down the demigod Alnilam.\n\nThe group's icon is a legendary testament, proof of the potential within every person for greatness. To follow in her footsteps, though grueling, is to walk the path of striving for improvement and perfection. But to fight for her cause is to enter a war against the order of reality; eclipsing the original to bring forth a new one in mankind's favor.\n\nGOI-850's most revered tale details Archine conquering a beast, described much like a European dragon, named Yharlashaye, in order to gain favor with the goddess of magic.\n\nNeeding a weapon capable of killing the monster, she ventured into the domain of the Archdaemon Carnis and battled her way through escalating challenges, eventually to face off against a semi-humanoid entity coated in impenetrable bone armor. Archine outmaneuvered the beast in swordplay and fashioned an unbreakable blade from the carcass.\n\nThen, joined by her brothers and sisters, Archine led them into battle against Yharlashaye on a mountain. Fighting for hours, the beast had cut them down to their final three. It then took to the sky, preparing to rain fire down upon the remaining mortals. Running up to the tallest hill, Archine lept into the sky after it, and the two clashed in the sky.\n\nStabbing her blade into Yharlashaye's neck, Archine disarmed its most devastating weapon and rode it back down to the ground where her comrades then began restraining the animal with chains. Removing the edge from the creature's neck, the creature's fell blood had caused it to burn bright as Archine enchanted it.\n\nPresenting the beast as a gift, the goddess rewarded Archine amidst the climactic first Storm, where she would serve as one of three generals for the city of Hyphera.\n\nAccording to GOI-850, humanity has always had to take from the world to change it; this act was no exception. I am inclined to agree.\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**Object Description:** 240 cm long claymore comprised of a dense ivory and metallic material, blue/red in coloration, with glowing yellow thuamic symbols etched along its fuller. When biological matter comes into contact with the sword, the edges will begin to harmlessly ignite.

I will carry your flame with me always.//\"\n----\n**Object Description:** A series of chains, composed of the same blue/red substance, each eighty-two millimeters thick.

Current plans are to amnesticize and release them once it has been concluded that they are safe for reintegration into their respective societies.\n\nHowever, a large number of the missing persons remain so thus far.
