The Type 1 Standard Personnel who were exposed to the light sphere are becoming more and more violent in their attempts to return to it, which they are referring to as their \"Smiling God\". They have also been constantly displaying disturbing smiles regardless of their current emotional state. It is the author's opinion that these personnel be terminated and the light sphere destroyed to prevent harm to the welfare and sanity of other personnel. \n\n------\n[[=]]\n**SUMMARY OF CURRENT STATUS:**\n[[/=]]\n\n2. It has been established that the light sphere is not a solid object. According to analysis of the object, it is a sphere of light with a diameter of one meter floating one meter above the ground with no discernible source. The light sphere's current color is a dark red tinged with a hint of purple, and its current light intensity is 5000 lumens. It has remained in stasis for approximately one week, showing no color variation or change in light intensity. Type 2 Special Personnel are currently investigating this change from its ordinary behavior of fluctuating light color and intensity.\n\n3. Type 1 Standard Personnel exposed to the light sphere express a desire to see it again[[footnote]] Excerpt from Interview 934-1: \"Please...Bring me back to my master...He commands it...\" [[/footnote]], and worship it as though it was a deity. Several have attempted to get others to join them in worship of their \"Smiling God\"[[footnote]] Excerpt from Interview 934-3: \"Come with me... My Smiling God wishes you to come. You shall worship Him. All shall hail He Who Dwells in the Sphere of Light.\"; Excerpt from Interview 934-5: \"Return me to His chamber at once. Enter it with me. Then, you shall see the splendor of the Smiling God.\" [[/footnote]]. Type 2 Special Personnel, however, express a fear of the object[[footnote]] Excerpt from Interview 934-2: \"Don't make me do that again. It burns me, hates me and all my kind. I don't want to know any more about it. I deny it the right to control me.\"; Excerpt from Interview 934-4: \"No! I won't go in again. Please...I'll do anything...//please//...\" [[/footnote]].\n\n4. It has been established that Type 2 Special Personnel are __not__ entirely immune to the effects of the light sphere. During exposure, they exhibit the same effects as Type 1 Standard Personnel; however, none have exhibited signs of any of its long-term effects[[footnote]] Excerpt from Interview 934-6: \"It was horrifying. I couldn't stop smiling, I couldn't stop laughing, I just...couldn't. It was as though I was possessed by something more powerful than myself. When I was retrieved, I felt -- I still feel a powerful hatred emanating from that...thing. All it wants is worshippers, and it hates me and all of the other //djinn// for being able to resist it.\" [[/footnote]]. Many express fear prior to exposure, although they know what they are being exposed to.\n\n5. The light sphere contains a massive amount of heat. Skin contact with the sphere's surface will cause immediate burns; however, the heat does not radiate outward from the sphere's surface. Metal objects held within it will usually sublimate. \n\n6.
