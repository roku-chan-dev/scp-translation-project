I'm based in the US, love writing action and comedy––occasionally both at a time––and am an unabashed photoshop enjoyer. I'm always looking to try new things and improve my craft, but I'm satisfied just to get a good laugh out of my readers.\n\nI'm aware this page is a bit bare at the moment, but consider it a prelude to hopefully great things to come! I'm always open to collaborating and trading crits, so feel free to shoot me a PM!\n\n\n||~ **Page** ||~ **Excerpt** ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5402 SCP-5402] || //Extra! Extra!
