Testing with the object is not to be carried out without the authorisation of the Site Director of SSF-16 and the Head Researcher of SCP-7554.\n\n@@ @@\n**Description:**\nSCP-7554 is the collective designation for several rounds of 5.45x39mm ammunition. Save for thin red streaks running from the tip of the bullet to the base, they are otherwise physically identical to 5.45x39mm 7N6 53gr [[footnote]] Grain. Bullet mass. (3.43g). [[/footnote]] ammunition, and can be fired by any 5.45x39mm chambered firearm.\n\nWhen an instance of SCP-7554 comes into contact with human blood, it will spin until it fully absorbs the blood. As such, upon a human being shot with an instance, it would continue tumbling and spinning within the body, causing massive internal injuries and haemorrhaging until the target is completely exsanguinated.\n\nAs of writing, there are 18 SCP-7554 instances in storage.\n\n@@ @@\n**Discovery:**\nOn 14/3/2004 at 08:45, all extant instances of SCP-7554 were found by police at the scene of a suspected gang shootout in an abandoned warehouse in Manchester, England.\n\nSix men were found dead in the premises, four on the first floor and two on the ground floor. The latter were found one laying prone on the floor while the other slumped next to a fire exit.  Dozens of bullet holes were found all around the room where the first four bodies were located. Four of the victims suffered gunshot wounds inconsistent with the bullets recovered, alongside being exsanguinated.\n\nAlso found at the scene was an unloaded assault rifle lodged underneath an industrial storage tank. The gun was identified as an AIMS-74[[footnote]]The export name of the PA md. 86, a Romanian clone of the Soviet AK-74.[[/footnote]], possessing several modifications, such as more modern plastic furniture on the pistol grip and foregrip, as well as a Picatinny rail on the dust cover for optical attachments. Later on, a magazine for the gun containing 26 rounds of SCP-7554 was discarded outside in a trash pile. Despite external damage, the gun was still functional.\n\nUpon being contacted by a mole within the Greater Manchester Police (GMP), the Foundation confiscated the SCP-7554 instances along with the firearm and used bullets.\n\n@@ @@\n**Addendum 1: Investigation**\nAt 10:00 am, upon investigation, the dead men were identified as members of the Bagnall Syndicate, an organised crime group run by Peter \"Big Pete\" Bagnall spanning Northwest England. The syndicate has been identified as responsible for multiple armed robberies and drug trafficking in the city, and had recently been subject to an appeal for information by Greater Manchester Police (GMP).\n\nThe six dead men were identified as follows:\n\n* Barry Keegan, 25\n* Charlie Black, 22\n* Bobby Sharp, 24\n* Declan Mills-Wilkinson, 23\n* Jake Barker, 19\n* Nathan \"Nets\" Ferguson, 22\n\nFurther information pertaining to the dead men was provided by Lester Briggs, a police informant within the syndicate.

The target was the organisation's leader, Harris Connelly. Despite killing 4 people, including a Connelly Firm lieutenant, Connelly himself managed to escape the scene. Forensics reports show that the injuries sustained on some of the bodies were identical to those found in the warehouse shootout.\n\nThe target was then seen again in central Stockport. The following is a transcript of what occurred.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE: 13/3/2004** \n\n**NOTE: Timeline was reconstructed from CCTV footage acquired from various businesses in the town centre, including the Golden Dove Inn & Café, on Fritz Row.** \n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**20:27:** Connelly is seen running in the streets then discards his bloodstained coat into a dumpster. He stops and looks around, before turning towards the Golden Dove. Concealing his gun, he appears to straighten himself before briskly walking to the establishment.\n\n**20:28:** Connelly enters the café, and walks towards an empty table in the back. He passes by some patrons, some of whom greet him.  He sits at the table as a waiter comes over. He is given a menu, from which he orders something, showing the menu towards the waiter. The waiter gives him a nod and retrieves the menu before going to the kitchen. Connelly watches the exit as well as the rest of his surroundings.\n\n**20:30:** Connelly is seen pulling out a phone from his trouser pocket and making a call. Connelly ends the call after 20 seconds. He appears calmer.\n\n**20:33:** A coffee is served at the table. Connelly begins drinking. \n\n**20:34:** After sometime, the manager walks past. The two share a nod.\n\n**20:45:** A black SUV parks in front of the café. Four masked men exit the vehicle. The manager is seen coming out of the restaurant towards the men. What appears to be an argument ensues.\n\n**20:46:** As this happens, a beige sedan[[footnote]] Beige Ford Focus. License plate number BD53 LUJ. The vehicle was reported stolen two months ago. [[/footnote]] stops adjacent to the establishment. Two more masked men exit the passenger seats and begin walking towards the commotion.\n\n**20:47:** The men from the black SUV turn back to the car as the manager watches. Suddenly, one of them turns back and punches the manager in the face. The two from the sedan stop in the middle of the street. The others quickly pull out their guns and motion to the two, who do the same. The gunmen rush into the café, opening fire. Connelly attempts to flee but is spotted and gunned down while patrons, staff, and pedestrians are seen scrambling away from the scene.\n\n**20:48:** The gunmen are seen roaming the building; two are seen stealing money from the cash register. The manager is lying outside motionless.\n\n**20:49:** The assailants leave the scene.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nBased on this log and the statement of Mr. Briggs, a seventh member of the hit squad was identified, namely the driver of the beige sedan. Due to the quality of the footage, neither the driver nor the number plate could be discerned. Investigation is underway.\n\n@@ @@\n**Addendum 2:**\nAt 1:15pm, police found the beige sedan near a construction site. Security camera footage captured a man coming back to the car, retrieving something and leaving. He was then tracked to a corner shop where his face was much clearer and identified as 21-year-old Oliver Scott. The suspect has not been seen since then and it has been confirmed he has not returned to his residence.

Apparently, he acquired a damn machine gun just for the task. Gave it to Barry cause he was the alpha.\n\n**Clarke:** Where'd he get it from?\n\n**Briggs:** Don't know. I just was there to see him give it to them. Probably some black market contact.

I couldn't hear it that well with all the noise, but I did hear enough...**cunts and what not**... to know he was bloody livid. I think he was on a call with Barry. He then cut the call then began discussing something with the other guys in there.\n\n**Brown:** What were they talking about?\n\n**Briggs:**  Well... I//(Takes a puff.)//... couldn't hear the next parts.

I really couldn't hear. Look! I'm putting my neck out for this, alright! If I was caught, I'm dead — they'd probably riddle me with that gun of his.\n\n**Brown:** Alright! Alright. We trust you.
