Access to this locker is to be barred to all male personnel, even if they're drunk and their buddies bet them they couldn't get in.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5972-J is a standard vacuum cleaner produced by The Kirby Company. SCP-5972-J appears to be a sentient predator. Males viewing SCP-5972-J will feel a sudden compulsion to stick their genitalia into the vacuum tube. SCP-5972-J will then activate at maximum power and... yeah... fuck...\n\nSCP-5972-J has a secondary memetic effect. Males reading about its effects will feel extremely uncomfortable. This is followed by a contraction of the thigh muscles until the legs fully cover the genitalia, and a series of sharp inhalations.\n\n**Addendum 5972-J:** Interview Log 5972-J\n\n> **Interviewed:** D-5748, a 25-year-old male\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Valen\n> \n> **Foreword:** Testing of the secondary effects of SCP-5972-J\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Valen:** I'm going to tell you what this thing does, and we're just going to gauge your reaction, alright?\n> \n> **D-5748:** Alright.\n> \n> **Dr. Valen:** So it's this vacuum cleaner, right? And when you see it, you want to put your dick in it.\n> \n> **D-5748:** That's fucked up, man.\n> \n> **Dr. Valen:** I know, crazy shit. Anyways, you put your dick in it, and it turns on.\n> \n> **D-5748:** (Turning visibly white, legs turning inwards) Oh shit...\n> \n> **Dr. Valen:** And then it just sucks your dick right off.\n> \n> **D-5748:** (Nose flared in disgust. Leans back and snaps fingers) Whoa shit!\n> \n> **Dr. Valen:** It sucks up the nuts too.\n> \n> **D-5748:** (Winces and covers his eyes) Oh god, man. What the fuck?!\n> \n> **Dr. Valen:** It's fucked up man. Like, seriously. Shit.\n> \n> **D-5748:** I've seen a lot of crazy shit here, but man, fuck this.\n> \n> **Dr. Valen:** I need to go out for some air. Want a drink?\n> \n> **D-5748:** I need a fucking 6-pack.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** D-5748 was glad to face his month-end termination, stating, \"At least they didn't put my dick in that fucked-up vacuum.\"\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
