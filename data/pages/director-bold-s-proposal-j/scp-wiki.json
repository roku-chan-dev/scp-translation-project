Additionally, affected individuals (designated SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1) are able to access the Foundation's private chatroom and discussion boards.\n\nCurrently, the only known way of preventing SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instances from viewing documentation is to erase it entirely, then place [REDACTED] or [DATA EXPUNGED] where it used to be. Alternatively, one can simply █████ ██████████ ████ ███ ████.\n\nBelow is a log of an SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instance accessing the Level 5 private chatroom.\n\n> → Guest04645 joined\n> <Guest04645> helo\n> <Guest04645> id like to join mtf alpha 9 pls\n> <Karablue>[[footnote]]O5-3's codename.[[/footnote]] Who are you?\n> <Karablue> I mean\n> <Karablue> The SCP Foundation isn't real\n> <Karablue> yeah\n> <Guest04645> i don't believ u\n> <Karablue> crap\n> <Karablue> I mean\n> <Karablue> Of course we're not real\n> <Karablue> I mean the foundation\n> <Karablue> Thats not real\n> <Guest04645> scp reel\n> <Karablue> It isnt\n> <Karablue> Actually, we're\n> <Corvus>[[footnote]]O5-7's codename.[[/footnote]] not allowing roleplay\n> <Karablue> Yeah\n> <Corvus> and you're roleplaying\n> <Corvus> which is against the rules\n> <Karablue> so if you don't stop roleplaying and accept that the foundation isn't real, then you can't be here\n> <Guest04645> whatever\n> <Guest04645> i know u guys r lying\n> <Karablue> Oh no\n> <cybersqyd>[[footnote]]O5-6's codename.[[/footnote]] This guys good\n> <Bright>[[footnote]]Dr. Clef's codename.[[/footnote]] is there any way we can get rid of him\n> <bluesoul>[[footnote]]O5-11's codename.[[/footnote]] don't worry guys i got this\n> bluesoul banned Guest04645\n> ← Guest04645 was kicked by bluesoul for: \"SCP isn't real, go away\"\n> <Karablue> Thank goodness.\n> <Corvus> Yeah, that could have been a serious breach of security.\n> <taylor_itkin>[[footnote]]O5-13's codename.[[/footnote]] Well done, team.\n\n**Addendum 1:** During its monthly meeting, the O5 Council discusses the immense threat SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC posed, and how to possibly deal with it.\n\n> [EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]\n> \n> **O5-1:** Now, for our next order of business, Two has prepared a discussion on SCP-001 and how we should deal with it.\n> \n> **O5-2:** Thanks, One. Now, we've noticed a drastic number of SCP-001-affected individuals, and after further research, we believe that we can solve this problem. But... it'll require some drastic changes.\n> \n> **O5-6:** What... kind of changes?\n> \n> **O5-2:** //[sighs]// First, I think we're gonna need to not have a public website.\n> \n> //[Large outcry from all members of the table.]//\n> \n> **O5-2:** I know, I know, I don't like it either.\n> \n> **O5-5:** We've been using the Wikidot domain for years! Removing our website would be disrespectful!\n> \n> **O5-2:** That's the other thing, Five. Wikidot is a poorly-\n> \n> **O5-5:** Don't say it.\n> \n> **O5-2:** -functioning website. It's barely secure, and we keep losing all our documentation to its weird infinisave glitch.\n> \n> **O5-12:** Next you're gonna say the link to our chatroom shouldn't be publicly accessible!\n> \n> //[Arguing ensues.]//\n> \n> **O5-1:** Enough!\n> \n> //[Room quiets.]//\n> \n> **O5-1:** Look, Two has a good point. Security is a bit lax. We don't //need// to constantly post Bright and SCP-173 memes to Reddit.\n> \n> **O5-8:** But-\n> \n> **O5-1:** I know, Eight. The peanut //is// funny. But we need to destroy SCP-001, even if it requires us to make sacrifices.\n> \n> **O5-10:** Yeah. Maybe we should take preventative measures so that all the sensitive content actually requires clearance to see, and isn't just underneath a collapsible telling people of improper clearance not to view it.\n> \n> **O5-2:** Thank-\n> \n> **O5-1:** However! Two, your ideas are still quite radical. Perhaps we can come to a conclusion that helps eliminate SCP-001, without throwing away our values and traditions.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Well, when people find it, and they ask if we're real, we can tell them that we're //not// real!\n> \n> **O5-1:** I think we may need to go even further.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Dang, this is bad. If they won't fall for //that//-\n> \n> **O5-9:** What was that thing Seven said, during that one incident?\n> \n> **O5-3:** He told him not to roleplay, right?\n> \n> **O5-9:** Yeah, yeah! Okay, I've got an idea!\n> \n> **O5-6:** I'm interested.\n> \n> **O5-9:** So what if we told people that this stuff, everything here, it exists, but not really! It would be like, uh... fiction! You know, like in books!\n> \n> **O5-4:** I like that! And we can say //we// wrote it, like creative writing stuff!\n> \n> **O5-1:** I think you may be onto something. Two, what do you think?\n> \n> //[Brief silence.]//\n> \n> **O5-2:** That's brilliant.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"display:none;\"]]\n=====\n\"Guys, please don't read our SCPs 🥺\"\n=====\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:more-by:calibold]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
