Although a mild memetic hazard has been included in this file, this memetic hazard will only affect members of the O5 Council.\n@@@@\nSo, why all this secrecy you ask? Why go behind the Overseers’ back and do this? \nWell, there’s an actual problem we need to solve. It’s not a Keter or an end of the world scenario we are dealing with this time, although utmost secrecy will be required.\n\nThe problem we have at hand is finding birthday gifts for the O5 Council.\n\nAfter what we pulled last year I think all our lines with Dr. Wondertainment will be monitored, so this time we will be on our own to create a big party.\n\nAlso, the Administrator informed me we are no longer allowed to use any Keter class SCP's to bring excitement to the party. Yes, this includes the Pinata sadly. \n\nWe do not need the Ethics Committee's approval, however!\n\nPut down your suggestions in this document and let’s make this a birthday to remember!\n.\n@@@@\n-Maria Jones, Head of the Party Committee. \n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** CakeStuff\n> **Author:** Gaurav 4686\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Img_gaurav_cake05.jpg link]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[/div]]",
