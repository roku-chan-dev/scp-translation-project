Any references to Documents-6067 outside of Foundation records are to be immediately reported and destroyed.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6067 is a seven-meter-tall sentient tornado. It was created during the filming of a commercial for a proposed Dr. Wondertainment toy \"Recyclone\". No other instances of SCP-6067 exist as Recyclone was never brought to market.\n\nItems with a volume smaller than SCP-6067 by 1mm or more are incorporated into the object upon physical contact, followed by a corresponding growth in the effective size of SCP-6067. Currently, all identifiable objects inside SCP-6067 consist of:\n\n* Various toys\n* Appliances such as a stove, refrigerator, washing machine, and dryer\n* One adult male corpse\n* An indeterminate number of workshop tools such as screwdrivers, a hammer, and a drill\n* Coat rack\n* Suburban house\n* The following note:\n[[div class=\"funtastic\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image professor_funtastic.png]]\n[[/>]]\nHi, kids!
