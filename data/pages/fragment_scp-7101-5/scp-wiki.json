Roufhous:** G'day, everyone. O5, Noosphysics, Applied Theology, thank you for coming here. As I'm sure you're aware, we are here today to talk a bit about SCP-7101, and a recent incident that she caused. So, did anyone here hear about eight people winning the same lottery yesterday?\n\n**Dir. Collymore:** The fuck?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Language.\n\n**S.R. Baley:** Excuse me, but how is that possible?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** SCP-7101, and we got a bit screwed over in this situation. By the time we learned SCP-7101 was involved in this malarky, news outlets had already contacted and started reporting on the eight different families who won. It's all being settled in court now, which we'll get full control of soon, but that's beside the point - this massive anomalous event was so clearly displayed to the public and we didn't do anything to prevent it.\n\n**O5-07:** Right, but how do you propose we //could've// done to prevent this?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Containment, or, more preferably, termination. Currently, the procedures we are conducting do virtually nothing to impede 7101, allowing this grand display of its ability to everyone.\n\n**O5-07:** You're proposing we kill //random chance//.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** SCP-7101 is //not// random chance. Er, Gabriel, could you explain?\n\n**Dir. Collymore:** 7101 is a deity, and while it's entirely associated with luck, it's also separate. Luck is bullshit, but people started giving this invisible force a person, started giving it little traits, started saying it's like this or like that, that we hate it or love it, effectively engaging in various forms of [[[SCP-6659|worship]]], creating a deity that has these powers and abilities, and is so well known and personalized that it's effectively self-sustaining. So basically, like we've stated before, it's an alien construct that has attached itself to humanity. It's unnatural, it's its own form of \"Luck\", and it has changed reality a great-big deal than if we never started giving Random a name.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Thank you. So yes, I'd like to, at the very least, contain this foreign anomaly that we're currently letting screw with humanity as much as it wants. And, if possible, I'd like to come up with some sort of solution today.\n\n**O5-06:** So, if I understand Director Collymore, if we take away all personality from SCP-7101 and the public, we can then sever its influence entirely?\n\n**Dir. Collymore:** Yes...but it would also kill it.\n\n**Dir. Tennanbaum:** Would not have been the first time we have killed a god.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Whatever it takes to stop this from happening again. Containment, termination, anything.\n\n**O5-10:** So, just for reference, what exactly would count as worshipping 7101?\n\n**Dir. Tennanbaum:** Well, anything superstitious. We have not been worshipping 7101 by talking about it like how we are, and to that point, I guess we are immune. But something like the average person thinking that finding a twenty-dollar bill on the ground was luck favoring them is continuing this false image of an invisible entity watching over them, which is, as Director Collymore said, has become effectively self-sustaining. We are snowballing right now, leading to such an egregious display of its existence.\n\n**O5-07:** So people are going to get luckier as time goes on?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Or //unluckier//. Which is why we should take the first shot and prevent another outshow of this.\n\n**O5-06:** Do you have any such ideas, Director?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** I have, a few...ideas, yes.\n\n**O5-06:** And they are?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Outlawing gambling, casinos, lottery, and other big forms of something happening by chance and rewriting human history to disinclude any and all representations or personifications of \"Luck\".\n\n= //A collective silence for 5 seconds//\n\n**Dir. Collymore:** You want to fundamentally change history and life... because eight people won the lottery?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** We're snowballing, as Kaleb said. It's going to get worse.\n\n**Dr. Fallen:** Or better, it thinks it's luck, right? Well, a big part of luck is good things happening to people.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Or it's going to get much, much worse. Something we do know about 7101 is that historically, she doesn't favor anyone. She just...does. She //could// make eight people win the same lottery, or she //could// make a pilot have a heart attack. She's benevolent, or she's the grim reaper, breathing down our, or worse, every single sentient creature at this very moment. Doesn't matter if you didn't believe in her before, she can, will, and has already affected you regardless.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** So yes, I'd like to kill random chance, and yes, I do intend to change history because eight people won the lottery, now can we get to that, please?\n\n**O5-06:** Do you have any suggestions for how we could do that?\n\n**Dir. Tennanbaum:** Preferably, access to SCP-6659[[footnote]] //##red|[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/admonition-hub [DESCRIPTION WITHHELD PER SITUATIONAL CLEARANCE] ]##// [[/footnote]].\n\n**Dir. Collymore:** Wouldn't work.\n\n**Dir. Tennanbaum:** Excuse me?\n\n**Dir. Collymore:** 7101 is conceptually way too massive, it'd be like trying to remove the concept of gravity, in all of its forms, from everyone, and I mean everyone. People, dogs, bugs. If we had the resources to purge SCP-7101 from all human subjects, then it would resurface from the fucking duck church of fortune. Doesn't even have to be a religion or more common forms of worship. A kid's angry that he got caught in hide n' seek? Blames it on his friend getting bullshit lucky? Well, there goes all our efforts. We would have to remove every single instance of this kinda concept from humanity, its history, and all of its media which, while possible, would be one of the biggest endeavors the Foundation has ever made.\n\n**Dir. Collymore:** Because eight people won the lottery.\n\n**O5-06:** And if we were to begin removing situations where luck comes into play, as Roufhous said?\n\n**Dir. Collymore:** I guess it would weaken SCP-7101, to a point where it can't make eight people win a lottery, it'd still require excising all forms of luck, fate, or fortune personification from history and media, which is a massive bitch in and of itself.\n\n**O5-06:** A large-scale amnestic drop isn't difficult, a misinformation campaign of this size is the problem.\n\n**O5-10:** If I may. Roufhous, you haven't given us a single example of a negative effect SCP-7101 has had on humanity.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Is her capability not enough for you? An omnipresent deity that can change reality to accomplish whatever she wants?\n\n**Dir. Tennanbaum:** And is growing in power. I concur; if we do not act now, we will regret it later.\n\n**O5-06:** So it's decided - we begin restricting forms of luck in order to weaken SCP-7101 to a state where it could be neutralized by SCP-6659?\n\n**O5-10:** Such a decision will be decided by the //whole// of the O5 council. Deicide is an important decision, let alone rewriting history and changing the world in order to accomplish such.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Well, I suppose that's all, then. I should like to be informed of your decision, Overseer. Right then, good day, everyone.\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n\n-----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 50px; margin: 40px\"]]\nTEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED.
