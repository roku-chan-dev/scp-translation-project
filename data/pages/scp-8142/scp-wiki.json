Those believed to be targeted by SCP-8142 report vivid dreams for up to a week before they encounter it. Encounters vary between individuals, but typically involve the subject waking up in the middle of the night. They are often transported to a secondary location, creating a scene of warped reality often described as \"dream-like\". Finally, the individual will engage in a conversation with a figure resembling a Chimera[[footnote]]A fire-breathing monster from Greek mythology depicted as a lion with a goat head protruding from its torso, and a tail ending with a snake's head.[[/footnote]] and the subject will return to where they originally fell asleep. \n\nAfter this encounter, subjects report feeling generally happier. There are no observed neurological changes within subjects after an SCP-8142 encounter and no memetic or cognitohazardous influence has been detected.\n\nVarious tests have been performed on SCP-8142 to determine its nature. Thus far, results show that it is not physical, psychological, spiritual, extradimensional, metaphysical, pataphysical or essophysical. Likewise, it is currently unknown why SCP-8142 specifically targets Foundation staff. Research into SCP-8142 is currently ongoing.\n@@ @@\n**Addendum 8142.1:** Log of notable SCP-8142 encounters.\n[[=]]\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #808080; width: 25%;\"]]\nPersonnel Name and Position\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #808080;  width: 45%;\"]]\nEvent Summary\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #808080;  width: 30%;\"]]\nNotes\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nLeonard Buchanan, recent hire for the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cryptozoology-division-hub Cryptozoology Division].\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nFollowing an incident in his second week of training that resulted in minor property damage, Buchanon was seen flying out of his accommodation that night. He arrived at a zoo holding various low-clearance objects contained at [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44 Site-44]. He made time to carefully read the information signs for each enclosure despite their illegible writing. Gradually, the walls of the zoo lowered and all the animals within began walking towards Buchanon in a single file line and they thanked him individually. Finally, a goat and a lion, tied together by a long snake told him that he was doing very well. Buchanon petted it and returned to his accommodation.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAfter this event, Buchanon completed his training and began working as a junior researcher studying [[[SCP-7088]]].\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAgent Aiden Hale, MTF Delta-14 \"Winter Wonderland\".\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAt 2:43 am, Agent Hale exited their quarters and began wandering the halls of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]. Snow began falling from the ceiling of the site, obscuring their vision. As they searched around for the door, several frozen corpses began rising from under the snow, and Agent Hale tried to re-bury them with little success. Eventually, the snowfall turned into a blizzard and they were submerged. They fell into a log cabin, and a maned mountain goat with a snake in place of a tail emerged from the fireplace. It discussed the state of global warming and different flavours of ice cream with Agent Hale for 32 minutes, at which point they left the cabin and emerged back at their quarters where they fell asleep.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nThe next morning, a draft for a retirement letter was found in Agent Hale's private computer.

The vibrations caused a green humanoid baby with three heads resembling SCP-9328 to form, it was connected to dozens of various hoses and its abdomen was open. Its feline head told Victor it was meant to be there, the same way he was meant to kill it. The baby prayed to him, asking him why it had to die. Victor told it he never knew, not even now. He shattered into a fine dust that re-constituted inside his car. \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nThe next day, Victor handed in a resignation letter. He is considered a vital member of his team, per standard procedure, the letter was declined and negotiations have begun to ensure his continued cooperation. Following reports from his on-site therapist, Victor was amnesticized of his incident during his time as junior staff.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nDr. Clark, lead supervisor for procedure\n110-Montauk.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #DBDBDB; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAt 4:12 am, Dr. Clark was seen outside Site-19 on an overgrown cloud atop a hospital bed surrounded by infant humans.

Requests to transfer to assignments deemed sub-optimal for productivity have increased, along with attempts to resign.\n\n**KNOWLEDGE:**\nIndividuals having had an experience with SCP-8142 have proven not to be under any anomalous influence. Proportionally, lower-ranking Foundation Employees have reported encounters; typically janitors or other staff assigned to unskilled labour. The rate of encounters has remained stable at 5-10 per day since the first report on 14/11/2025. A way to prevent these encounters has not yet been discovered.\n\n**RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE:**\nRecreational break time has been increased from 15 minutes to 17 minutes to improve staff morale, additionally, Foundation insurance is now mandatory and employees are restricted from applying to third-party insurance providers. High-risk personnel[[footnote]]Designated as staff with clearance level 2 or below displaying symptoms of discontent.[[/footnote]] are being closely monitored and employment efforts are being made to replace previous staff. The O5 council has approved an increase in the Fire Suppression Department's budget which is being used to fund additional surveillance and reinforcement.\n\n**NOTES:**\n//Greetings, team.

The boxes and furniture inexplicably move to the sides of the room, forming a clear path from the chair to the door. She rubs her eyes and stands up, the jacket already on the floor.//\n\n//She takes her firearm and hesitantly sneaks out of the office. It is filled with many more pictures of herself: selfies of hiking trips in photo holders, framed portraits, posters, and polaroids stuck directly onto the wall. Gertrude does her best not to look at any of them. She doesn't have time. Swallowing her curiosity, she reaches to open the door, it simply falls back flat like a domino.//\n\n**Gertrude:** Oh. Fuck.\n\n//The stark halls outside have contorted, they are longer, and curved, twisting into rectangular-shaped tunnels. Gertrude looks at the paintbrush in her hand. It must be from the painting that isn't on the wall. It won't be, she decides, and discards it. She proceeds forward, up, and around the tunnels until the walls open and melt away. It is an office cubicle now. Her first one, the SCP emblem adorns the wall and chattering voices overlap around her. Pillars of blood seem to extend into a ceiling that never arrives. Gertrude stops completely and holsters her gun in her trousers, unlike the first time, she's not excited. Gertrude sees the building for what it is: a prison.//\n\n**Jr. Researcher Victor:** Turner!

As she continues to fall, the silhouettes of the O5 council rise, her knees buckle and she collapses onto the ground. Although their mouths aren't visible, Gertrude can see them move and feels them exhale, but she doesn't remember what they said. Behind her, another Turner rises to meet them.//\n\n**Researcher Turner:** I understand that it may be uncomfortable, but without you, it would fall apart. Sometimes you need to hold your nose and close your eyes before taking a step forward, and that's all I'm asking of you.\n\n//The figure in front of her flashes between a multitude of people, she recognizes them all: the ones she damned. The air breaks away and Gertrude is left back in her office, the faces continue to change, but manually as she flips their pages, just like she did long ago.//\n\n//Victor is in there.
