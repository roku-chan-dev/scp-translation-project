Its endless halls carry every book that has or ever will be written (and several that won't). Scholars from worlds unknown stalk its aisles and trash bins for forbidden knowledge. It would take several lifetimes to read the contents of even one shelf in the Library.\n\n+++ [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com So — what are you waiting for?]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[tabs]]\n[[tab Checking in to the Librarian's Station]]\n++++ //What is a Library?//\n[[<]]\n\nIt's a lot more than a man-made structure full of books. It can be eclectic collections of all assortment and mannerisms. Arcane knowledge and cookbooks deserve to sit side-by-side, but they are nothing without readers. Without a head to sit in writing is just the pretension of abstract shapes seeking meaning.\n\nUltimately, libraries are those groups treasuring what little anyone can truly know.\n\nIn my younger days, I failed to accomplish my dream. Becoming a library unto myself, seizing all which could be known and fitting it within my own person. Despite my best intentions I've snuffed out the life of more ideas than any Bookburner could ever dream of incinerating.\n\nUnleashing the damnation of fire and forgetting on so many of my fellow patrons is my penultimate regret, before allowing hubris to make me who I am today. So as you browse all the knowledge you could possibly ask for there must always be that voice whispering in your ear to remind you that mortality is a virtue.\n\nLet the Library be the one which keeps all that which cannot be remembered. Else then you may never be able to forget.\n\n-- //[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/forgotten The One Who Knows]//\n[[div_ class=\"fancyhr\"]]\n-----\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n++++ //Where is the Library?//\n[[<]]\nWell, you're standing in it. Go ahead and gawk. Everyone does, their first time. Don't worry, the shelves aren't going to fall down anytime this century. It just feels like it because they're so high and narrow. The Library is... I suppose the best way to describe it would be a hub. Kind of like this hub, except instead for worlds. The Library is at the root of every world, universe, and timeline that has ever existed, or will ever exist. You guys have that saying, right? \"All roads lead to Rome\"? Yeah, it's kind of like that. No matter where you are in reality (or sometimes out of it), you can always find a way back here. Get it? A Way?\n\nOh. Man, they don't even tell you what Ways are anymore? Alright, well, a Way is a kind of wormhole -- the labcoated fucks at the Foundation probably have some technojargon name for it, but we call them what they are - Ways. Of course, all Ways have Knocks -- a kind of trick to get in. There's one in New York where you have to pour chicken blood over a manhole. This one's easy, though. You just need someone who's been inside to invite you. So long as I'm here, you can get though.

As far as we know, the place is quite literally infinite, in every direction. At night, try looking up -- you can see the stars. Sometimes you come across entire clouds forming at the tops of shelves. Don't ask me where the light comes from -- I couldn't tell you. Matter of fact, there's a lot about this place nobody knows. Nobody knows when it was founded; it just seems to have always been here. Nobody knows where the books come from; they just appear.

It remains as the only official SCP sister site. It's a collection of stories that explore strange and fantastic corners of the world, hidden from ordinary eyes. Some of the stories take place in the distant past, taking the form of legends and fables. Others are from the modern day, hiding in the shadows just out of sight. The basic premise is that there are strange things that are not quite of our world. Some are dangerous, some are merely fascinating. They are all in some respect extraordinary.\n\nUnlike SCP, Wanderer's Library stories have no set format; entries, as they are called, can be prose, epistolary, multimedia, or anything else you can dream up. The genre is similarly fluid -- we have everything from high fantasy to urban horror. The only consistent theme, if there is one, is that stories in the Library should try to evoke a Sense of Wonder, a sense that there is a larger world beyond the one we know. In the world of the Library, these wonders are hidden, but never truly far away. But never forget that this is a wilder world than our own, and it's never entirely safe, either.\n\nThe Library's contents are a sort of Venn diagram with the larger SCPverse. Entries are free to be set in the larger universe, and use Groups of Interest or characters from the universe at large, but standalone works in their own universes or worlds are also perfectly fine -- indeed, the majority of entries are of the latter sort. **Reading works on the site is the single best way to get a feel for the tone.**\n[[/<]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Navigating the Library]]\n[[<]]\nAs previously stated, reading is the best way to get a feel for the Library and the tone of the stories, but here's some additional information to help you get acquainted with actually finding those stories and learning about your new home away from home.\n\nThe Library is an infinite space for all intents and purposes, and should be treated as such. It is quite easy to lose one's way, but don't fret - typically a friendly docent will guide you to the place you are looking for. Additionally, regardless of size, the Library remains well organized, divided into wings with many shelves full of stories tucked between, and halls where the non-written stories find a home. [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/wing-one Wing One] is the oldest section of the Library, known as the Hidden Nest, and is typically where all newcomers will find themselves. [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/wing-two Wing Two] is relatively newer, and known as the Sea of Words, is an actual ocean (or lake, or puddle, no one knows!) featured in the Library's center.   Finally, [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/hall-one Hall One], while both smaller and newer than the two shelves, features all of the artistic content within the Library - from drawings, to music, to reshaping the look of the Library itself.\n\nThe layout of the Library, while infinite and constantly changing, is surprisingly one of the most well known parts of the Library. The actual history, structure of the staff, what they do, and how the Library functions and why is much murkier, but many Wanderers have their own [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/universe-rewrite thoughts and theories.] Generally though, new Wanderers are pointed towards the staff run [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/orientation Orientation], which covers the basics all newcomers should know.
