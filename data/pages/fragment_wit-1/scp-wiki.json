  "content": "[[span class=\"blackout\"]]Nobody ever expects it, and, let's be honest,[[/span]] you were [[span class=\"blackout\"]]in no way expecting anything to happen of note today, given the emptiness not only of the day but of[[/span]] your whole life, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that same, dreary, day in, day out, living and surviving and living[[/span]] and still you keep fucking living [[span class=\"blackout\"]]so now we have to do something, and all of the sudden the fuck-ton of emptiness[[/span]] you had [[span class=\"blackout\"]]becomes[[/span]] a whirlwind of pain [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and sadness, but reality and humanity and that //spark//,[[/span]] you know [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the one, the **magic** spark that pushes us towards and away from greatness and history, the knifes blade that controls and fights and sharpens[[/span]] your wit, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]until, wit, there is nothing left to witness, and without a witness how can[[/span]] you possibly exist, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]but of course[[/span]] you can't, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]nobody can, who thinks that they are truly worthy of self-observation, this perverse internal as you mentally reach out to all that makes your domain,[[/span]] your mind, soul, and body, and body, and flesh and blood and organs and skin and rot [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and life and pain and only, every so often, if one is especially lucky,[[/span]] you are given the chance to create [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and there is no true parallel to that of progenitor, the sculptor //ex nihilo//, exhale now and never excel even in[[/span]] emptiness, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]but then you realize that it is --all that we destroy-- transforms in our minds' eyes, and what was nihilo is now ex -- escape velocity is never easy to obtain, of course,[[/span]] you live by that mantra, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]stuck between two forces of gravity, pushed and pulled and stomped and lifted[[/span]] up, up, up [[span class=\"blackout\"]]but only just high enough that when[[/span]] they let you [[span class=\"blackout\"]]go, you are tumbling, falling, plummeting, witnessing your own inevitable death until you[[/span]] finally [[span class=\"blackout\"]]**crash**, dive down deep into the loving[[/span]] embrace [[span class=\"blackout\"]]of our captors, the parasitic disease we call family, lost and aghast in a cavalcade of needful things, useless things, things that wit not to witness, losing who //they// are to the inevitable, creeping, exciting, logic-defying truth, that while all things may end in[[/span]] death, you are not [[span class=\"blackout\"]]all things[[/span]], you are not death, you are [[span class=\"blackout\"]]not[[/span]] a witness, you are [[span class=\"blackout\"]]not, witnessing //ex vivo en nihilo//,[[/span]] the memories of nihilo [[span class=\"blackout\"]]exhale and exhaust and terrify and multiply extracting[[/span]] the essence of [[span class=\"blackout\"]]what it means to forget, and there it is, that is the[[/span]] sin [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that we endeavor to oblige, the errata we long to erase, nihilo y ,,nihilo,, y nihilo, until we once again remain, and return, but where[[/span]] do you [[span class=\"blackout\"]]return when the only scrap of life that you[[/span]] cling to [[span class=\"blackout\"]]is held to wit only by[[/span]] the witless one, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]withering and wilting under the eyes of the observers, the observed, the ex-ambassadors of the land where[[/span]] dreams [[span class=\"blackout\"]]live until they are dreamt, a dying planet hemorrhaging the hopes and nightmares and compilations of what was once //you//, but has never truly been your**self**,[[/span]] of [[span class=\"blackout\"]]course, nothing can ever truly hope to be **self**, after all,[[/span]] **self** [[span class=\"blackout\"]]is as **self**less as **self** does, and does the **self**[[/span]] salvage the [[span class=\"blackout\"]]selvage[[/span]] end [[span class=\"blackout\"]]of our untimely strings of fate, the ever-woven tapestry of irrelevant emptiness, the taunts that echo through the[[/span]] empty [[span class=\"blackout\"]]school prisons, the impacts that rock the very foundation upon which[[/span]] //self// [[span class=\"blackout\"]]is built, and with it, the death of observation and the reincarnation of identification as commodity, the capitalistic nightmare that gives power to those without wit, those who have[[/span]] the right stuff, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the special sauce, the magic that[[/span]] flows [[span class=\"blackout\"]]out through the mind and[[/span]] __onto__ [[span class=\"blackout\"]]__the page__,[[/span]] the [[span class=\"blackout\"]]ex-sculptors now[[/span]] consumed [[span class=\"blackout\"]]into //nihilo//, those special[[/span]] few who [[span class=\"blackout\"]]deign to inscribe their images and memories and hatred and longing and memories, of course memories, we[[/span]] remember, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]remember members whose membranes we punctured just to get a better view,[[/span]] a glimpse into [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that which we cannot be, those we are unable to live as, the un-un-dead, living amongst[[/span]] the monsters [[span class=\"blackout\"]]of the digital worlds we conceive just to lock away on a server, the server[[/span]] who witness[[span class=\"blackout\"]]es our greed, the child, the idea, the //genesis ex nihilo ex genesis//, the one who is left -- you suddenly realize,[[/span]] you --**__alone__**-- [[span class=\"blackout\"]]are a witness to today.[[/span]]",
