U know wat time it is xDDD its me again! I wish u all have enjoyed ur winter days (with snow) bc theres only one January 2024 :))))) Just like Dec 2023, i also hav got plenty of things to do ;) so i was hoping that all these artworks would be finished nicely… Well at least ive put quite some thoughts into them :DDDDD and i think that will do?? Whatever, i hope u like them! \n\n(not gonna sort them this time, seems meaningless :p sooo lets just start over here!)\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**//******//**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[image \nhttps://s11.ax1x.com/2024/03/01/pFwxUv6.jpg]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n//**Merchants’ Style**//\n\n//{{For business… and shooting… and dirty tricks.}}//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\nThere’s always a new character design shows up and it’s VKTM for this time. The original author [[*user Grigori Karpin]] has written lots of great stuffs for them and luckily they are still updating. All those works are so entertaining to read and think :) They are such a fascinating GoI and I just can’t hold back my passion to draw them xD! I feel interesting to consider them as a robot but I have had no time to finish a formal design painting, so bear with me! It will pop up next month I suppose :3\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**//******//**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2024/03/01/pFwxQDU.jpg]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n//**The Revelation of Ion**//\n\n//{{It’s our last hope to seize the redemption. }}//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\nThis is actually an experimental piece. I went clueless when I was designing the deity form(dunno whether this is the proper phrase) of Ion and it just took forever to rethink it. Still I assume this experiment would continue next month since I’m not very pleased with the result.\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**//******//**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2024/03/01/pFwxuvV.jpg]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n//**The Valentine Dessert Recommended**//\n\n//{{A recommendation from Chef Ambrose. You know it’s his duty to provide a decent atmosphere, therefore, he tried hard.}}//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\nYes its blood. Def blood.Trust me n trust him. :d\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**//******//**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2024/03/01/pFwxng0.jpg]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n//**Time Passes By**//\n\n//{{One day Iris would like to receive her retirement in the dark, leaving all the golden antiques covered with shimmering dust.}}//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\nGuess whos missing her already? ;)))\n\n\nSo thats all for this month! I know ive said it the last time but u know… next month will just be the same xPPP I wish u all enjoyed!!! I love u guys(as always!) and cheers to the busy winter time!!! :DDDDD",
