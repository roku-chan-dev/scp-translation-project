Sites are often built in locations in relatively close proximity to civilian populations, where facilities would require such cover.\n\n++ Area\n\nFoundation facilities designated as Areas are //clandestine// facilities, meaning that civilians are not aware of their existence at all. Such facilities are often built far away from civilian populations and may contain highly dangerous anomalies; the vast majority of Areas have extreme fail-safe measures such as on-site nuclear warheads.\n\n+ Facility Sections\n\n++ Sector\n\nSectors are sections of Sites or Areas that are designated for specific purposes, such as containment, research, or storage. The exact usage of Sectors vary from facility to facility and is dependent on the facility's primary purpose and size.\n\n++ Unit\nUnits are self-contained sections of Sites or Areas such as those containing Biological or Dimensional anomalies and are designed to self-seal in case of a breach or other catastrophic event. All personnel entering or exiting a Unit must typically undergo a full decontamination procedure.\n\n+ Prefixes\n\nThese prefixes are often used to denote specializations of facilities or facility sections and are generally only used in internal communication.\n\n++ Armed\n\nArmed denotes a facility or facility section with abnormally high physical security concerns, either due to containment of violent hostile entities or threat of outside attack. Such facilities typically have a large amount of military-grade weaponry and vehicles as well as a disproportionately large number of permanent security staff; in the case of a full facility, this typically entails a detachment of at least battalion or regiment strength.\n\n++ Biological (Bio)\n\nBiological containment facilities or facility sections deal with infectious or otherwise biohazardous anomalies and are both isolated and self-contained to prevent the possible escape of such anomalies.\n\n++ Containment\n\nContainment facilities or facility sections are primarily equipped and intended for the containment of anomalous objects, entities, or phenomena.\n\n++ Dimensional (Dim)\n\nDimensional containment facilities or facility sections deal with extradimensional apertures or anomalies exhibiting inconsistent or warped spacetime.\n\n++ Humanoid\n\nHumanoid containment facilities or facility sections primarily deal with sentient, sapient human or near-human entities capable of understanding and complying with instructions. These are essentially analogous to a prison facility for anomalous entities.\n\n++ Protected\n\nProtected facilities and facility sections are \"safe zones\" kept free of anomalous influence. No anomalies are allowed within these facilities at any time.\n\n++ Provisional\n\nProvisional facilities are those that are established or built around an immobile anomaly. Provisional facilities typically contain only a single anomaly.\n\n++ Reliquary\n\nReliquary facilities or facility sections are designed for handling artifacts and objects of religious or historical significance.\n\n++ Research\n\nResearch facilities or facility sections are designed for either the handling and study of anomalies or anomalous materials or research and development of new containment schemes and methods.\n\n++ Storage\n\nStorage facilities or facility sections are intended for long-term storage of non-anomalous or inert anomalous objects with no risk of autonomous interaction.\n\n+ Miscellaneous\n\nThese are Foundation facilities or locations that do not fall under the standard organizational structure.\n\n++ Observation Posts\n\nObservation Posts are tiny facilities established in a multitude of locations worldwide. Often limited to small standalone buildings or single units within larger buildings, Observation Posts are typically used to monitor regional communications for flagged content, as well as monitor nearby Foundation facilities. Many Observation Posts are also used as secure communications hubs or safe-houses by undercover Foundation agents.\n\n+ Facilities List (Abridged)\n\nThe following is a partial list of notable Foundation facilities. Please note that this list is incomplete; many Foundation facilities are not listed here due to operational security requirements, because their purpose and/or location are classified. Additional facilities involved in the containment of Nexuses of anomalous activity are [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nexus-series| listed here]]], and facilities operated by International Branches of the Foundation are [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/secure-facilities-locations| linked here]]].

The entries here are intended as inspiration and a sample of how Foundation facilities might look like and is not intended to be all-inclusive or exhaustive; there are plenty that are either not listed here due to only being used in a few obscure places or are inconsistently used. If you are writing and want to use a facility, you are free to make up your own.\n\nFurthermore, in-universe, inconsistencies can also be explained via disinformation or timeliness of information; Site-06, for example, was not always located in France and is actually explicitly listed as the third such facility to receive the designation. Certain other sites might no longer be in operation or even been deliberately fabricated to mislead agents from rival organizations.\n\n----\n[[size 120%]]**Just How Big Is The Foundation?**[[/size]]\n\nThis is entirely up to the author. Some choose to believe that the Foundation is very small, consisting of only half a dozen facilities or less and no more than a thousand personnel. Some choose to believe that the Foundation is vastly larger and far-reaching, employing hundreds of thousands of personnel squirreled away in hundreds of facilities around the globe. Neither is incorrect and whatever works better to further your narrative is the one that's appropriate.\n\n----\n[[size 120%]]**Adding New Entries**[[/size]]\n\nNew Facilities may only be added to this list if the Site or Area features in three or more articles. Members of the [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main| MAST]]] Collab Log Pruning Team will remove any entries that do not meet this requirement, so it's best to message a team member before adding a new Facility. \n\nAnyone is welcome to add additional Contained Objects (SCPs) or Notable Incidents (Tales and SCPs where the facility is featured prominently but not actually containing the object) to the entries for existing Facilities, as long as the SCP or Tale describes the Site or Area in a way that is consistent with the description here. For new SCPs and tales, it's best to wait a few days to make sure that it isn't deleted or rewritten. Humorous Addenda are for Joke SCPs, and for tales that are obvious parodies. \n\nThe SCP Lists for [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-06-scp|Site-06]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-17-scp|Site-17]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-19-scp|Site-19]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-23-scp|Site-23]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-66-scp|Site-66]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-73-scp|Site-73]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-76-scp|Site-76]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-83-scp|Site-83]]] and [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-area-12-scp|Area-12]]] are long enough that they've been placed on separate fragment pages and listed via the [[include]] component, as are the incident lists for [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-17-incidents|Site-17]]] and [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-19-incidents|Site-19]]], but you can still add to them, you'll just have to edit the list on the fragment page.
