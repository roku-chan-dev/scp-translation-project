However, since the objectives of SCP-15625-KO-J align with the Foundation's principles of \"securing and containing anomalous entities,\" an exception has been made, and the Foundation has decided to cooperate with SCP-15625-KO-J. The Containment Department discusses containment measures for SCP-15625-KO-J post \"goal achievement.\" Until then, the entity has been appointed as a \"Special Advisory Consultant\" at Site-21K.\n\n**Description:** SCP-15625-KO-J looks identical to a regular human. The phrase \"Doctor's Orders\" was written on his clothes at the time of discovery. The Foundation suspected the subject to be one of \"Little Misters\", an assortment of humanoid anomalies made by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wondertainment-hub| Dr Wondertainment], which the subject admitted. SCP-15625-KO voluntarily appeared at Site-21K, and **desperately** requested help in exchange for being contained.\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-15625-ko-j/15625drw.png|align=right|caption=\"Dr Wondertainment\", provided by SCP-15625-KO-J.]]\nSCP-15625-KO-J was going through the PhD programme in Wonderology^^TM^^, and his supervisor was Dr Wondertainment. When the programme did not go as planned, he impulsively escaped Wonder World[[footnote]]A pocket dimension or extradimensional space known as the GoI, \"Dr Wondertainment\"'s base.[[/footnote]]\n\nThe following is the interview conducted after SCP-1562-KO-J's containment.\n\n> **Interviewer:** Dr Rosa Marcuse\n> \n> **Interviewee:** SCP-15625-KO-J\n> \n> //(SCP-15625-KO-J reacts to Dr Rosa Marcuse's entry. The subject is trying hard to push down his emotions.)//\n> \n> **Dr Marcuse:** As per SCP Foundation guidelines, you have been designated as SCP-15625-KO-J. We'll be calling you by this name. Would that be alright?\n> \n> **SCP-15625-KO-J:** ...Sure, whatever, it doesn't matter. As long as it's not that fucking Wonder World. (Under his breath) ,,That son of a bitch,,...\n> \n> **Dr Marcuse:** SCP-15625-KO-J, are you ready for the interview?\n> \n> **SCP-15625-KO-J:** (Frustrated, confused) What? Oh, okay. Sorry. Let's get on with it.\n> \n> **Dr Marcuse:** We suspect you're one of the group of humanoid anomalies called \"Little Misters\", created by the group of interest, \"Dr Wondertainment\", as some of your traits align with them. Is that true?\n> \n> **SCP-15625-KO-J:** Yes, it is. Technically speaking, anyone in Wonder World except for \"Dr Wondertainment\" is a Little Misters.\n> \n> **Dr Marcuse:** I see. Are you from Wonder World?\n> \n> **SCP-15625-KO-J:** Correct. I spent almost my entire life there, and I just... escaped.\n> > **Dr Marcuse:** Escaped?\n> \n> **SCP-15625-KO-J:** Dr Wondertainment was my supervisor. I was going through a PhD programme in Wonderology... But then...\n> \n> //(SCP-15625-KO-J stops saying, and he starts frowining.)//\n> \n> **Dr Marcuse:** Hey, are you okay?\n> \n> **SCP-15625-KO-J:** **I spent [REDACTED] years after the programme to be \"Dr Wondertainment\"! But that doctor bastard is not giving me a degree!**\n> \n> **SCP-15625-KO-J:** //(Tears flowing down his face)// **I spent ██ years making toys, █ years coming up with a theoretical basis for them, and ██ years in Wonder World doing paperwork for him! And that's not enough? How much do you want from me, Wondertainment!**\n> \n> [The statements were omitted, as it is too devastating to be recorded in the SCP Foundation Database]\n> \n> //(Dr Marcuse starts crying as she listens to the raging SCP-15625-KO)//\n> \n> **<Interview continuation deemed impossible. Interview terminated.>**\n \nSecurity returned SCP-15625-KO-J to his designated containment chamber. The subject continued to sob and rage for about three days.\n \n> Anyone with higher education enough to work for the Foundation will cry a river when they listen to his story. \n> - **Dr Rosa Marcuse**\n \n> Yep, made me cry. Sigh... That [REDACTED] years... \n> - **Site Administrator Gangsu Lee**\n \nDisciplinary action due to 'inappropriate action during interview' was revoked for Dr Rosa Marcuse,\n for the above reasons.\n \nA follow-up interview three days later, after SCP-15625-KO regained stability, stated that the subject was tasked by Dr Wondertainment to 'gather all Little Misters, ' which will lead to the consideration of granting his degree. SCP-15625-KO-J claimed that this task is \"a very gruesomely arduous and difficult task\" and was why he impulsively escaped Wonder World and came to the Foundation. SCP-15625-KO-J expressed extreme anger and sadness during his testimony, and tranquilisers were administered by Site-21K staff.\n \nAs per the Special Containment Protocols, negotiations are not typically conducted with humanoid/sapient/communicative anomalous entities as per standard responsive protocols. However, as his goals of collecting all Little Misters made by Dr Wondertainment aligns with the SCP Foundation's goals, Administrator Gangsu Lee of Site-21K proposed the Korea Regional Command to cooperate with SCP-15625-KO. After a 24-hour-long discussion, Administrator Gangsu Lee's proposal was accepted by Administrator Noraemine's direct orders.\n \n> Several oppositions were present, but they, too, were saddened by Little Mister Skip's interview video. \n> - **Grace \"Noraemine\" Choi, Administrator of Korea Regional Command**\n \n**Addendum 15625.01:** Following Administrator Noremaine's directive, the Foundation has been assisting SCP-15625-KO-J in achieving its objectives. Personnel assigned to the 'Little Misters' containment operation requested the entity's cooperation. This proposal was approved by a majority vote, and SCP-15625-KO-J was appointed as a special advisory consultant for the containment of the 'Little Misters,' assisting Foundation personnel in their containment and research activities.\n \nFoundation personnel receiving assistance from SCP-15625-KO-J unanimously expressed great satisfaction with the knowledge and efforts provided by the entity.\n \n**Incident 15625.01:** Thanks to the collaboration between Foundation personnel and SCP-15625-KO-J, the Foundation was able to contain all 'Little Misters' SCP entities. The SCP Foundation has determined that all of SCP-15625-KO-J's requirements have been met.\n \nSCP-15625-KO-J informed \"Dr. Wondertainment\" that his task was complete and requested a review for his doctoral degree.\n \nApproximately 168 hours after the entity requested the doctoral degree review, the following message was received:\n \n> **Wow!** You've just collected all of Little Misters, a limited edition collection from Dr. Wondertainment!\n> \n> ##A901DB|**Unfortunately, your degree has been denied.**##\n \n> **AAAAAAGH! WONDER, YOU BASTARD!!! LET ME OUT!!!** \n> - Upon recieving the message, SCP-15625-KO-J blurted out and fainted.\n \n> That'll make even the black moon howl. \n> - **Site Administrator Lee Gangsu, after checking the message next to SCP-15625-KO-J.**\n\n \n**Revised Special Containment Procedures:** The subject is to be contained in a private room modified from the D-class personnel quarters of Site-21K. Site-21K psychological treatment staff is to monitor the mental status of the subject regularly.\n \nSite-21K research personnel are increasingly requesting SCP-15625-KO-J to be their research assistant. All results are pending.\n[[footnoteblock]]",
