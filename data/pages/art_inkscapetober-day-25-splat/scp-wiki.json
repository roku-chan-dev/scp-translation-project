Depicted on the shield is a muddy horse on some grass, a reference to [[[SCP-6169]]]. The choice for the supporters is obvious. These supporters, or at least their heads, are pretty much created from scratch; something that is more uncommon in this series than I'd like. But alas, there's more work to be done.\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** It is a bit of a stretch, but I'd say that if the galloping of this horse made a sound, it would be 'splat'. You know, because of all the mud.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-24-extinct| Day 24: Extinct]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-26-connect| Day 26: Connect]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** hungrypossum.png\n> **Name:** hungrypossum\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nhungrypossum.png is a composite.
