There is no need for SCP-5825 anymore.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5825 is the SCP Foundation. Well, not really. But for all intents and purposes, it is.\n\nI started this document years ago. Decades ago, maybe even centuries. It might've even been when we were still around. I was very much in denial about what I was, what had happened, all of it. I was trying to find the solution to it. But I'm not sure the solution exists. Even if it does, it doesn't really matter. This document was an event, and a phenomenon, myself for a time I think. I'm not even sure what it was originally anymore.\n\nIt no longer makes sense to document this. The more I think about it, the more I wonder if it ever truly made sense. Most of what I wrote happened after, and I think I was just trying to keep some sense of normalcy. But I don't need that anymore.\n\nThe Foundation is gone. It's been gone for a very long time. We had a good run, didn’t we? We did good work, we saved lives, helped people, kept the peace. But we don't need to do that anymore. Honestly, there's not really even a \"we\" anymore. There are others out there who remember, I'm sure of it, but they don't uphold these values anymore. And frankly, neither do I. I haven't for a long time.\n\nI honestly don't know why I came back. Nostalgia, I guess. Back to the place where it all started. The new world. The new understanding of myself. The shift. I guess I wanted to see the ocean as that big, mysterious beast I once knew it as, feel the sea mist on my face, and remember what I was like before. I miss who I was before. But I'm happy for who I am now. I hear the waves crashing on the shore even as I type this, old yet new. And I am at peace. I want to revisit the woman I was before, knowing what I know now, and see the world as she used to see it, just for a moment. Remember how far I've come.\n\nAnd when I'm done, I'm going to sit on the shore and rest. I'm tired of tragedy. I just want to watch the waves go in and out.\n\n[[div class=\"danke blue\"]]\n@@> Save@@\nChanges saved to SCP-5825\nWhat would you like to do?\n@@         @@1.
