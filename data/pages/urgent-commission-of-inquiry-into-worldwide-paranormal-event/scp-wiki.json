I'll give you an example. My name is Achille Van Acker, Chairman of the Commission, of the Kingdom of Belgium.\n> \n> **R-F:** LÃ©on Dussault, representing the French Republic.\n> \n> **R-Ch:** Zhao Guangdong, from the People's Republic of China.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-R:** Maksim Varfolomeyev, representative of the Russian Federation.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-Ca:** Christopher Leclerc, representing the Canadian governement.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** The Administrator, from the SCP Foundation.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** I will remind everyone that the \"Administrator\" is going to be referred to by its title during our future work. Continue, please.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-I:** Alessandra Capozzi, of the Republic of Italy.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-G:** Bertolt Weber, I'll be representing the Federal Republic of Germany.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **D.C. al Fine:** D.C. al Fine, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-J:** Kana Yoshida, from Japan.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-UK:**  Edward Addams, representing the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the name of His Majesty.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-US:** Jonathan Brown, from the United States of America.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** Perfect, thank you, everyone. Did everyone read the agenda correctly? We can therefore proceed with this meeting. To begin, I would like to invite the Administrator to take the floor in order to set the tone.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, in these troubled times, I feel obliged once again to reassure each and every one of you. Whatever the geopolitical turmoil in the human world, I can assure you that our organization will be able to protect us from any anomalies that may arise in the future.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-US:** Mr. Administrator, a large part of our budgets, as well as those of many other governments around the world, are allocated to you, and yet we're not even allowed to see the results! How can you guarantee that this money is really being used for protection and research?\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-R:** What's even the point of research? You may find me cold, but it seems to me that if anomalies are disrupting our society, they should be eliminated! Base yourself on the GOC!\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** Gentlemen, gentlemen. Have no fear. Your money is being put to good use. And for your guarantee, ask yourself this: Are supernatural entities destroying your cities? The simple answer is no. Because the Foundation is there. As for our research, you should know we are cold, not cruel. We won't destroy every living species or ancient artifact just because you're too cheap to provide us with the money to preserve them.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** Please, do not attribute words with negative connotations to the delegates present. This will not be tolerated.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** The research we carry out ensures that we learn more about the paranormal world every day, and enable us to better protect the public. Knowledge is a weapon. And an efficient one.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-Ch:** Do we really need you? \n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** I'm sorry?\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-Ch:** Why are you necessary to us? The GOC is protecting us from abnormalities as much as you do while costing us much less. Don't you think we could do without you?\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** Now I will tell you something about the GOC. The only reason they seem to be doing a good job is because we're taking care of everything they're not doing. The only reason the GOC still exists is because we //allow// them to exist.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **D.C. al Fine:** Mr. Chairman, please! The SCP Foundation cannot continue to look down on us like this. \n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** This meeting should be about cooperation, let me remind you of that. Yes, Mr. Dussault? \n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-F:** We are here today because we all want one thing: to protect the human race. And we can never achieve that alone. Let's put an end to our political disagreements. The GOC, the SCP Foundation. These organizations exist and are not about to disappear. The debate we need to have is not about the existence or legitimacy of these organizations, but rather about our cooperation with them. \n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** Thank you! Mr. Leclerc, you have the floor.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-Ca:** Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we all know, the GOC is a public institution. It is subventionned by the governments of the world, via the United Nations. Now, the SCP Foundation is a private institution. It is subventionned, yes by us, governments, but mostly via its own means. \n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **D.C. al Fine:** Are you suggesting an alliance with //these// people?\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** I will remind you that the floor is for the Canadian representative, not you. Continue.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-Ca:** What I'm saying is that the SCP Foundation has the knowledge, has the expertise, and has the most powerful minds on the planet. In the meantime, the GOC has the resources, the diplomatic connections, and the support of the countries of the world, as well as that of the Council of 108. \n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-J:** An alliance between the two would make the most powerful organization!\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-Ca:** Exactly.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** Sorry to interrupt, but that couldn't work. We have too many differences on too many subjects.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-G:** What are those differences? How could they make it impossible for the two organizations to act as one?\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **D.C. al Fine:** The usage of expendable personnel. The ''Class-Ds''. We strongly reject the violation of the Human Rights that the Foundation commits daily, and I hereby am asking this commission to do something about it! We can't let the Founda...\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** The sacrifice of these people is necessary. They do not suffer. Well, they do, but not unnecessarily. They are the only thing that keeps the world a livable place.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **D.C. al Fine:** You have no remorses, you monster. Go to hell!\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** Order! If you can't contain yourself, you'll be kicked out of the meeting. This is your last warning. And that applies to all of you. Mrs. Capozzi, you have the floor. This is the last interaction about item 3 of the agenda.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **R-I:** I think the usage of Class-Ds could be reduced, even eliminated, in the event of a coalition between the SCP Foundation and the GOC. This project has my vote.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **D.C. al Fine:** I won't express myself on that point, otherwise I'll be seen as vulgar.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** Alright. We're going to take a break in order to regain control of our emotions. After this break, we will resume the meeting with item 4 of the agenda, and no deviation will be tolerated. \n>\n\nThe Administrator is escorted out of the room by MTF Alpha-1. Under-Secretary-General D.C. al Fine promptly imitates him, followed by Strike Team 3707. The rest of the dignitaries present decided to remain seated and talk amongst themselves. Chairman Van Acker can be seen on the phone in a corner of the room, presumably in conversation with His Majesty the King of the Belgians.\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ 05-13\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Fucking D.C al Fine[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Things aren't going our way, I see.[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]You care explaining?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]I don't have a lot of time.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]The Administrator's job is that hard?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Could be better.[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]The meeting had barely begun and it had turned sour.[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]They aren't trusting us as much as they did, I'm afraid..[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Don't worry.

I remind you that any deviation will not be tolerated, and I reserve the right to expel anyone who makes a disturbance. Understood?\n> \n> //The representatives nod in affirmation.//\n> \n> **Chairman:** Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the ethical issues and the lack of confidence in the world of paranormal organizations, we are going to proceed to a vote about the SCP Foundation. Before we proceed to the vote, I invite you to debate the following question: //Should the SCP Foundation remain exempt from the law, and continue to operate in the same way as before this meeting?// Mr. Guangdong, I would like to invite you to take the floor.\n> \n> **R-Ch:** Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to remind you all that although some of the practices of the SCP Foundation are... questionable, we mustn't forget that these practices are designed to protect the human race. To ensure the common good.\n> \n> **R-G** Even if our government has decided that the actions of the SCP Foundation are a direct violation of human rights or even a series of crimes against humanity, we are still unable to regulate their actions. Although many of us have little confidence in the Foundation, we cannot risk alienating them. It's difficult to trust you completely. No offenses.\n> \n> **The Administrator:** None taken. I totally understand why you would be reluctant to accept our ideals and our methods. I can assure you that I would invite you all to visit our facilities if it didn't endanger our work and humanity as a whole.\n> \n> **R-J:** And there is not a //single// facility we could visit? Not one?\n> \n> **The Administrator:** If that was the case, you would already have visited it. I assure you, I'm deeply sorry that our work is so sensitive. And restricted.\n> \n> **R-UK:** The SCP Foundation has my complete trust. I know that certain methods may be seen as horrible by some governments, but I see them as necessary.\n> \n> **R-I:** They don't have my trust, but I too feel like they are necessary. \n> \n> **R-R:** We must not forget that the GOC could be more heavily funded, and could counter-balance the SCP Foundation.\n> \n> **D.C. al Fine:** Not counter-balance. Control. If you would just fund us more, we could be able to control the Foundation. The GOC already has your trust, and ethical debates would not be necessary! \n> \n> **R-Ca:** As much as I love the GOC, you could not do the job the SCP Foundation is doing. I thank you for your services, but don't expect anything else.\n> \n> **R-US:** I do believe in the GOC. Sorry, but the SCP Foundation doesn't represent our ideals of American freedom.\n> \n> **Chairman:** I'm going to stop the debate here. I'll hand out some pieces of paper, and then we'll move on to the vote.\n> \n> //Chairman Van Acker is seen distributing pieces of paper across the table.//\n> \n> **Chairman:** I'll repeat the question. //Should the SCP Foundation remain exempt from the law, and continue to operate in the same way as before this meeting?// Your choices are Yea, Nay, Abstain.\n> \n> //The representatives fill in their votes, and then Chairman Van Acker collects each paper.//\n> \n> **Chairman:** Let me count the votes.

We will serve you with honor and respect.\n> \n> **The Administrator:** I'm going to tell you that I'm going to answer \"Yea\" in the vote. The GOC still protects us against //some// things.

Don't worry, we're nearly finished. Mr. Brown, you have the floor on item 6 of the agenda. Following Mr Brown's words, we will proceed with the debate.\n> \n> **R-US:** Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you all know, worldwide paranormal events are constantly on the rise. More and more people are witnessing these events and becoming victims of these abnormalities. I know you're supposed to be handing out amnestics to the people affected, but how can you be sure that all the people affected by these events are actually being treated? And more and more anomalies are appearing. How can you contain them so quickly and effectively? I don't want to be an alarmist, but I think you need to be prepared for your Foundation to come out in the open!\n> \n> **Chairman:** This possibility will be examined on item 8 of the agenda. We're still on item 6: //Concerns about the recurrence of worldwide paranormal events.// Please, stay on this subject to ensure that the meeting runs smoothly. Continue.\n> \n> **R-US:** What I'm trying to say is that every day the world becomes riskier.\n> \n> **R-Ca:** And we would all love to hear what the GOC and the SCP Foundation are doing about it.\n> \n> **R-G:** Now that you are talking about it, it does sound like things are not as under control as you tell us.\n> \n> **R-I:** Indeed. It seems like we are more in danger than ever.\n> \n> **R-J:** How many SCPs have you contained? Seven hundred, something like that? Now imagine how much aren't contained!\n> \n> **R-F:** Makes you wonder if we actually are protected against these things!\n> \n> **Chairman:** We can now move on to item 7 of the agenda.\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **The Administrator:** Do you want to address this?\n> \n> **D.C. al Fine:** Well I could. Do not be aware. We, the GOC, are actively terminating parathreats as we speak, and many are being observed by our services! This increase in worldwide paranormal events is under control, and soon we'll flatten the curve. Planet Earth is safe with us.\n> \n> **The Administrator:** Mrs. al Fine is right. This situation is totally under control. If things were going sour, you would already know it. We took an oath to protect the human race. If we had any problem doing that, we would have already asked you for help.\n> \n> **R-R:** I'm not convinced.\n> \n> **The Administrator:** Maybe. But you still are protected. We die in the dark so you can live in the light.\n> \n> **Chairman:** Does anyone else wish to speak? No? Then we'll move on to item 8. \n> \n> **R-US:** If I may continue on what I was saying on this before?\n> ##transparent|Your text here.##\n> **Chairman:** You may.\n> \n> **R-US:** If your Foundation is to come out in the open, what is your plan?\n> \n> **The Administrator:** A Broken Masqu... A revelation of our Foundation to the world has been discussed many times internally, and we now know how we will manage this situation.\n> \n> **R-UK:** Details?\n> \n> **The Administrator:** No.\n> \n> **D.C. al Fine:** The GOC, for its part, is a governmental organization. As such, we already are entrusted by a lot of people, and the GOC being brought under the spotlight would be easily dealt with.\n> \n> **R-UK:** The GOC isn't the problem here. Mr. Administrator, do you seriously expect us to blindly trust you, without having any information or details about your work?\n> \n> **The Administrator:** Precisely.\n> \n> **R-UK:** Go fuck yourse...\n> \n> **Chairman:** Order! That kind of language will not be tolerated, Mr. Addams!\n> \n> **The Administrator:** Your confidence is needed if you want everything to go well.\n> \n> **Chairman:** I think that's all for item 8? Right? Perfect, moving on to item 9 of the agenda. Does anyone have anything else to add for today?\n> \n> **Representatives:** ...\n> \n> **Chairman:** Alright, let's move on to item 10, the closing speech. Mr. Varfolomeyev, you have the floor.\n> \n> **R-R:** Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are here today, if I am here today, it's because we have an objective in common. This objective is the protection of the human race, and is a noble cause! Even if we all disagreed on something, I must thank you all, and thank your respective governments, for doing so much work to protect our populations. Even if we all have resentments towards each other, let's try to ignore them. Let's respect and thank each other.\n> \n> **Chairman:** Thank you, Mr. Varfolomeyev! Date and time of the next meeting, now.\n> \n> **R-US:** Is it necessary to have a next meeting?\n> \n> **Chairman:** Are there any objections to not scheduling another meeting at this time? Very well, I therefore declare this meeting closed. Thank you all!\n> \n> **R-US:** I have one last question for Mr. Administrator.\n> \n> **The Administrator:** Yes?\n> \n> **R-US:** How is the Chaos Insurgency doing?\n> \n> **D.C. al Fine:** The //what//?\n> \n\nThe Administrator gets up and quickly leaves the room, closely followed by MTF Alpha-1.\n\n##transparent|Your text here.##\n\n##transparent|Your text here.##\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ 05-13\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]How THE FUCK does he know about the Chaos Insurgency[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]WHAT??[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Who?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Jonathan Brown.
