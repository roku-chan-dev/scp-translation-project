Like, deconstructive or whatever.\"\n\nOvergang and Joey stared at the enormous red bauble that towered over nearby buildings, pensively sipping eggnog. It had several hundred minuscule trees hanging off the side of it. Overgang posed a question.\n\n\"So, it's an hour and ten to midnight. What happens when it's Christmas?\"\n\n\"Presents happen.\"\n\n\"Presents happen?\"\n\n\"Presents happen. Everywhere.\"\n\n\"Elaborate.\"\n\n\"It literally causes Christmas miracles.\"\n\n\"Elaborate more.\"\n\n\"Sick children will walk, Tiny Tim will get his presents, Scrooge will see the light. The town will be filled with cheer and goodwill, children will run downstairs only to see Santa Claus pop up the chimney. Rich people will let beggars into their houses, every church bell will ring twelve times. A cranky old man will smile for the first time in twenty years. Kids will ice skate while laughing happily, and be joined by their otherwise dismissive parents. Snow shall fall down, leaving beautiful white fields by morning. John McClane and Hans Gruber shall fight a war of wills, little Macaulay Culkin will fight off a pair of thieves. The Grinch's heart will grow three sizes, and Charlie Brown's sad little tree will get the love it deserves. Peace on earth, goodwill to man. The perfect Christmas.\"\n\n\"Well, that sounds lovely, if a bit boring.\"\n\n\"And of course, since Christmas is about the little baby Jesus and the mother Mary, every virginal female in the city will spontaneously give birth, whereupon the newborn is promptly crushed by a pile of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.\"\n\n\"That's more like it.\"\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
