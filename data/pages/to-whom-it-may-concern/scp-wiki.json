Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/23/2017 at 5:24 AM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nTo whom it may concern,\nMy name is Andrew Roberts and I am the [[[SCP-5226 | head of corrections]]] for the Explanation and Research Department.\n\nI would like to formally request all files you hold on SCP-6192-1-EX.\n\nThank you,\nDr. Andrew Roberts\n\n[[/div]]\n---------------------------------\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** A. Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**From:** Reintegration Committee (Reintegration@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/23/2017 at 8:00 AM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nHello Dr. Roberts,\n\nWith all due respect, this is a very odd request. As the department that holds the information for all entities that are currently in protective custody by The Foundation, we are very reluctant to share these files with anyone. Could you provide us with more information on why you need our files?\n\nRespectfully,\nDr. Tanya Fuller\n\n[[/div]]\n--------------------------\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Reintegration Committee (Reintegration@ec.scp.fo)\n**From:** A. Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/23/219 at 2:13 PM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nThere seems to be a discrepancy within our files for SCP-6192-1-EX. It would be very helpful to us if we could compare information between our 2 departments.\n\nThank you\n\n[[/div]]\n--------------------------------\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** A. Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**From:** Reintegration Committee (Reintegration@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/23/2017 at 2:30 PM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nDr. Roberts,\n\nWe have no problem helping you correct your discrepancy but I must say it is concerning that it would involve our department. Are you saying that SCP-6192-1-EX may have been mislabeled as an EX? If so we may have a major problem on our hands. Please clarify.\n\nThank You,\nDr. Tanya Fuller\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Reintegration Committee (Reintegration@ec.scp.fo)\n**From:** A. Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/23/2017 at 2:30 PM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nWe have reason to belive that there may have been a mix up during SCP-6192-1's final interview. As you know, during containment SCP-6192-1-EX was held in Sector-20-C. This Sector is adjacent to some of Site-138's conference rooms. At the time this was not of concern based on our belief that she was an instance of SCP-6192. However we now fear that SCP-6192-1-EX's abilities may have made her privy to conversations held in these conference rooms. One of those conversations being between researchers in EXaRD before SCP-6192-1-EX's final evaluation.\n\nI realize that this may signify a large breach but I assure you things are under control and this can all be quickly resolved as soon as SCP-6192-1 is found.\n\nSo again, If you could supply us with any files you have about SCP-6192-1's whereabouts we would greatly appreciate it.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** A. Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**From:** Reintegration Committee (Reintegration@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/23/2017 at 2:30 PM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nDr. Roberts\n\nThis is clearly a large breach and I must insist you report this to your superiors. I will contact the agent in charge of SCP-6192-1's case and see what we can do about bringing her in. I will update you on the situation as soon as possible.\n\nThank You,\nDr. Tanya Fuller\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Reintegration Committee (Reintegration@ec.scp.fo)\n**From:** Dir. Thomas Weld (T.Weld@ec.scp.fo)\n**CC:** A. Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/23/2017 at 2:30 PM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nDear Dr. Fuller,\n\nThis is Director Weld. \n\nI want to thank you for working with us but I see no reason to escalate this further. Reporting this would only cause unnecessary panic and, might I add, look bad on both of our teams.\n\nI will work on correcting our files and once you have the SCP back in containment, I think everything should be clear.\n\nThank you,\nDirector Thomas Weld\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dir. Thomas Weld (T.Weld@ec.scp.fo)\n**From:** Reintegration Committee (Reintegration@ec.scp.fo)\n**CC:** A. Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/23/2017 at 2:30 PM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nDirector Weld,\n\nNeither I nor the Reintegration Committee will be dragged into your sad attempt to hide your mistakes. After this ordeal is over I will be filing a full report including these emails. I must say it is quite disheartening to know that our newest department to further the understanding and humane regulation of anomalous entities is already resorting to deceitful practices. Shame on you.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dir. Thomas Weld (T.Weld@ec.scp.fo)\n**From:** Reintegration Committee (Reintegration@ec.scp.fo)\n**CC:** A. Roberts (EXaRD@ec.scp.fo)\n**Time:** 05/24/2017 at 6:30 AM\n**Subject:** RE: SCP-6192-1-EX\n**Attachments:** None\n[[/div]]\n------\nDear Dr. Roberts and Director Weld,\n\nI know my last email may have come off rather hostile and I would like to apologize for that. I understand you are only attempting to do what is best for your department and clear up this little mishap as simply as possible. Again, you have my apologies.\n\nAs it pertains to SCP-6192-1, it would seem our agent who was in charge of her case has also lost contact with her. The last known address we have on file for her seems to not exist.\n\nNo worries. I'm sure that together our departments can clear this all up without need to escalate it further.\n\nBest Wishes,\nDr. Tanya Fuller\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n  |first=false | last=false | hub=no |\n  |previous-url=/mirror-in-your-mind | previous-title=  Mirror In Your Mind |\n  |next-url=/through-the-looking-glass| next-title=Through the Looking-Glass|\n  |hub-url=/ | hub-title=Explanation and Research Department\n]]\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n.email-example .collapsible-block-folded a.collapsible-block-link {\n    animation: blink 0.8s ease-in-out infinite alternate;\n}\n@keyframes blink {\n    0% { color: transparent; }\n    50%, 100% { color: #b01; }\n}\n.email {border: solid 2px #000000; width: 88%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.5)}\n.email-example a.collapsible-block-link {font-weight: bold;}\n.tofrom {margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; padding: 1px 15px; border-left: solid 3px maroon}\n[[/module]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
