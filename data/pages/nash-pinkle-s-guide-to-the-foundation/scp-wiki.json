This tale is based on a conversation I had in 2012 over IRC with one basic premise: How can you explain concepts about the Foundation //badly//...but //correctly//? \n\nIt started with tags, moved on to SCPs, and even Foundation staff. I apparently kept a list in a notepad file that's been sitting in my documents folder since then, and I stumbled across it this week while looking at old SCP files on my laptop. Enjoy.\n\nThanks to [[*user Croquembouche]] for CSS help.\n\n[[[reixis personnel file|More from this author]]]\n[[include info:end]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n/* Hide the original page title */\n#page-title {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n/* Make my fake page title look like the original (thanks SCP-2998) */\n.page-title {\n  border-bottom: solid 1px #bbbbbb;\n  color: #990011;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  margin: 0 0 0.6em;\n  padding: 0 0 0.25em;\n  font-size: 200%;\n}\n.page-title p {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n\n//Nash Pinkle was a facilities specialist employed by the SCP Foundation. Though his employment has recently ended, he did express interest in becoming a Foundation researcher, and at one time attempted to submit the following “guide” as a body of research work for review. It remains here for archival purposes only and **should not be used for reference**.//\n\n> \"Someone wouldn't really use this for reference, now would they?\"\n> \"...\"\n> \"Don't look at me like that.
