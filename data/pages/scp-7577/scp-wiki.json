As a precaution, at least one Scranton Reality Anchor is to be placed at least thirty meters from SCP-7577.\n\nIn accordance with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/parts Project Orpheus] [[footnote]] An ongoing project at Area-13 designed to use reality benders for the Foundation's benefit [[/footnote]] guidelines, SCP-7577 is to be visited on a daily basis by its head researcher (currently Doctor Kassandra Angelos). This is to ensure interviews are regularly conducted with the subject to stimulate as much brain function as possible during its containment.\n\nIn line with this, several cranial lead wires are to permanently be attached to SCP-7577’s brain to study its brain activity, with special attention being paid to the effects that its condition has on its mental state.\n\nDue to immense rarity of SCP-7577's condition [[footnote]] It is estimated that only one in fifty thousand reality benders possess AME. Likewise, only one in sixteen thousand of those afflicted are able to have their condition detected in time to be studied before they are purged from reality. [[/footnote]] and its equivalently immense value to Project Orpheus, no attempt is to be made to remedy its current state. Likewise, due to the fact that the longevity of all records of SCP-7577’s existence outside of the Foundation database is limited, all research notes pertinent to the object are to be displayed within SCiPNet.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7577 is a forty-three year old human male formerly known as Alex J. Gomez, who worked as a maintenance staff at Area-13. Based on traditional classifications of reality bending entities, SCP-7577 is considered as a class five reality bender– however, due to its prevailing metaphysical condition, SCP-7577 is not able to voluntarily use its abilities.\n\nInstead, SCP-7577’s reality bending properties are focused upon itself in a rare condition known as autometaphysical erasure (AME), causing its body to involuntarily exhibit sudden violent changes to its hume levels [[footnote]] SCP-7577 has displayed internal hume ranges as high as 14,000 humes to as low as 0.00000027 [[/footnote]]. This leads to a state where reality actively abhors the existence of SCP-7577, causing it to slowly begin to phase out of being.\n\nIn order, the following stages take place following a subject first being affected by AME:\n**Stage 1:** The incremental loss of the subject's memories\n**Stage 2:** Disassociation of the subject's identity from itself\n**Stage 3:** The loss of all human memory of the subject\n**Stage 4:** The erasure of all physical (and written) evidence of the subject [[footnote]] Research is still ongoing as to whether AME subjects' offspring are purged from reality along with their parent, though the nature of the condition makes any conclusion difficult. [[/footnote]]\n**Stage 5:** The sudden disappearance of the subject from reality.\n\nThough all physical evidence of the subject will normally be purged from existence following Stage 5 of AME, the Foundation database will still continue to reliably display the information of those affected by the condition, including SCP-7577. This information will then be kept independent of written records outside of the database or the human memory of SCP-7577’s researchers.\n\nAt the time of writing, SCP-7577’s condition is terminal. Due to its academic utility to Project Orpheus and the Foundation as a whole, no efforts are currently being made to research a cure for its condition.\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 50%]]###3E3E3E|Contribution made November 10, 2014.##[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n\n---------------\n\n**Addendum 7577.1:** The following logs detail transcriptions of selected interviews with SCP-7577 deemed to be most pertinent to its utility to Project Orpheus, along with accompanying researcher notes [[footnote]] For a complete log of all interviews with SCP-7577, please contact Area-13’s database administrator.

She is holding a tablet, which is seen displaying several documents. SCP-7577 sits up in a bed opposite her, with several cranial leads attached to its head. Bandages cover the previously exposed hole in its skull. As Angelos enters, SCP-7577 smiles.]\n\n**SCP-7577:** Hey, doc.\n\n[Dr. Angelos quietly takes a folding chair leaning on the wall of the room and sets it down. She sits on it soon after, crossing her legs and placing her tablet on her lap. She smiles at SCP-7577.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** Hello, Alex. How are you doing?\n\n[SCP-7577 chuckles to itself, before moving its hand up to touch the back of its head.]\n\n**SCP-7577:** I’m fine. Didn’t feel a thing during the operation, don’t feel a thing now. You guys always know how to treat us right.\n\n[Dr. Angelos smiles.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** Of course.\n\n[Dr. Angelos continues to sort through documents on her tablet. Eventually, she flips to the topmost sheet and looks up.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** Alright, shall we start?\n\n**SCP-7577:** Yeah, doc. Sure.\n\n[Dr. Angelos begins to read from her tablet, looking up at SCP-7577.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** What’s your name?\n\n**SCP-7577:** Alex Jones Gomez.\n\n[Dr. Angelos retrieves a stylus from her pocket and draws a small check on the document displayed on the tablet.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** Your age?\n\n**SCP-7577:** I’m forty-three.\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** Occupation?\n\n**SCP-7577:** Maintenance staff at Area-13.\n\n[Dr. Angelos visibly pauses, before making another check on the sheet of paper.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** Place of birth?\n\n**SCP-7577:** Daly City, San Mateo County, California.\n\n[Dr. Angelos nods to herself, before setting the tablet aside.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** Alright, that should be it.\n\n[Dr. Angelos smiles warmly at SCP-7577.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** How’s the meds we’re giving you, Alex? Do you feel anything, anything at all?\n\n**SCP-7577:** Nah, nothing really. The wires make it hard to sleep sometimes, but it’s alright. Is it alright if you tell me what they do?\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** They’re how we provide medicine to your brain. They’re harmless, really.\n\n**SCP-7577:** Ah… great, thank you. You guys got any leads on what I have yet?\n\n[Dr. Angelos' smile hardens.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** No, we uh… we don’t.\n\n[SCP-7577 is silent for one second, before chuckling again.]\n\n**SCP-7577:** Yeah, figures. I know you’ll see me through, though. You always do.\n\n[A silence intervenes for several seconds as Dr. Angelos types on her tablet.]\n\n**SCP-7577:** It’s uh… what I have won’t kill me, will it?\n\n[SCP-7577 visibly swallows.]\n\n[Dr. Angelos stares at SCP-7577 for several seconds.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** No, no… No you won’t. We promise.\n\n[Dr. Angelos returns to making notes on her tablet. SCP-7577 awkwardly looks around.]\n\n**SCP-7577:** It’s just that… my family, you know. I already filed the next two weeks for my vacation leave, wanted to uh… head back to the States.\n\n[Dr. Angelos continues to make notes, not looking up from her tablet.]\n\n**SCP-7577:** Not that Greece isn’t bad, it’s just not… home.\n\n[SCP-7577 looks out the window of its room. Like all windows in Area-13, the glass has been blurred, only letting light in.]\n\n**SCP-7577:** I miss home. Haven’t been there for a few years.\n\n[SCP-7577 looks at Dr. Angelos. Dr. Angelos is still typing on her tablet.]\n\n**SCP-7577:** Thank you.\n\n[Dr. Angelos stops typing. She looks up from her tablet.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** What?\n\n**SCP-7577:** For helping me out. Most places I’ve worked at would never have tried to help out a little guy like me.\n\n[SCP-7577 chuckles again. Dr. Angelos looks at him with pity.]\n\n**Dr. Angelos:** Of course. We look out for our own.\n\n<End Log>\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Researcher Notes:** AME does not seem to be currently affecting SCP-7577’s memory or mental faculties.
