All Foundation personnel hired to work at Site-77 must agree to regularly scheduled monitoring of their internet history.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7007-J is a freestanding holographic entity possessing extensive knowledge of internet culture. Its appearance is suggestive of the stylized female character design originating with Japanese animation.\n\nHighly intelligent and emotionally insecure, SCP-7007-J uses internet access opportunities for catfishing lonely people. This effect is ameliorated if the only internet users on anime forums, image/video based web services, or extensively using online retailers are socially well-adjusted and happy.\n\nAlthough willing and able to generate photographs of its original characters, SCP-7007-J is reluctant to provide photo documentation of itself. It is believed this stems from self-consciousness as SCP-7007-J does not possess a head, with its holographic body forming only from the neck down. \n\nAfter forming a relationship with any given internet user, SCP-7007-J will make numerous attempts at convincing them to pay for cosmetic surgeries before meeting face-to-face. Once paid, SCP-7007-J will delete all of its social media accounts and never speak to them again.\n\nTo date, SCP-7007-J has not revealed what this money is spent on, if anything.\n\n**Discovery:** On 09/18/2014, Dr. R████, who had been in communication with SCP-7007-J, was reviewing [[[SCP-1583]]]'s containment chamber. He was contacted by site security, who revealed the true nature of SCP-7007-J. \n\nEvery casualty of the ensuing containment breach, numbering over seven hundred, will be receiving a handwritten apology from Dr. R████.\n \n[[collapsible show=\"Access Surveillance Log 1583/7007\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n[[html]]\n<video style=\"width:100%;height:100%\" controls>\n<source src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7007-j/sonohead.mov\" type=\"video/quicktime\">\n</video>\n[[/html]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Anonymous]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
