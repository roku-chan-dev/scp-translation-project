The DFPO designation was created as an alternative means of cataloging objects associated with SCP-8986.[[/footnote]]) affected by SCP-8986 :\n\n* The object is not self-animated.[[footnote]]Automata animated by normative mechanisms are not considered self-animated under this criteria.[[/footnote]]\n* The object has never been biologically alive.[[footnote]]This criteria exists primarily to exclude corpses and objects constructed from corpses, which may naturally retain residual mensemic energy. Objects constructed using materiels derived from traditionally unintelligent organisms generally qualify for DFPO designation, but may be excluded at the discretion of RG-Θ225.[[/footnote]]\n* The object is not host to a spirothaumic transfer from a conscious being.\n* The object is recorded as having a menseme score above zero. \n\nExperiments indicate that the likelihood of a given object being affected by SCP-8986 positively correlates to the object's resemblance to a living human person; however, occurrences of SCP-8986 are not necessarily contingent upon a realistic likeness. A verified DFPO will return consistent menseme scores across multiple consecutive tests;[[footnote]]Any inconsistencies in the menseme scores of verified DFPOs (excluding those that have been damaged or otherwise altered) have only been observed as being characterized by a gradual accretion over an extended period of time.[[/footnote]] however, measurements generally differ between DFPO subjects regardless of outward similarity. \n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n+ Experiment Log\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n\nThe following is a truncated review of experiments conducted by RG-Θ225, summarized in plain language for the purpose of conveying the SCP-8986 phenomenon and its research to personnel outside RG-Θ225.

A score below 20 typically indicates an underdeveloped or hindered consciousness. A score below 10 may indicate that a consciousness is severely debilitated, in early development, or merely residual. _\n _\nAlmost all non-anomalous humans return consistent mensemic readings across multiple tests. By contrast, it is typical for intelligent anomalous objects such as SCP-1486 to exhibit greater variation in menseme scores, necessitating a greater number of tests. The exact reason for this disparity is unknown, though the variations are believed to be indicative of material fluctuations in mensemic activity rather than a margin of error. _\n _\nIt may be observed that the consistency of DFPO-A201's results display a greater similarity to normative human intelligence than the results of the tests conducted with SCP-1486. However, at this time there is no evidence to suggest such a resemblance to the human baseline is anything more than superficial. _\n _\nDespite its physical appearance and unusual personality, SCP-1486 possesses all the characteristics necessary to be considered a non-living animate person, and following the Sapient Objects Act of 2015, has been afforded many of the same rights granted to living human SCP objects of a comparable hazard level.  _\n _\nBy contrast, DFPO-A201 is wholly inanimate and displays no connection to anomalous phenomena apart from triggering SCP-8986. As per the previous experiment, DFPO-A201 was chosen at random from a publicly operating department store, along with 9 other mannequins which displayed no mensemic activity. Following this experiment, DFPO-A201 was placed in an on-site storage locker for archival purposes. ||\n\n------\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8986/crashdude.jpg\n|caption= DFPO-A874.\n|width=400px\n|align=center\n]]\n\n||~ [[size 140%]] [[span class=\"boldTag\"]]Experiment 8986-0031[[/span]] [[/size]] ||\n||~ [[span class=\"boldTag\"]]Purpose[[/span]] ||\n|| Determine if a mensemically-sensitive person can identify a DFPO. ||\n||~ [[span class=\"boldTag\"]]Subjects[[/span]] ||\n|| DFPO-A874, a moderately damaged crash test dummy composed of plastic and aluminum with a documented menseme score of 33.[[footnote]]All electronic hardware removed prior to testing.[[/footnote]]  _\n _\nIrene Scarmer, a high-menseme individual employed by the Foundation to assist in researching conscious energy due to her history of correctly detecting non-living animate objects during field operations. _\n _\nThe Rhine-Fort Psionic Resonance Scale defines a \"high-menseme\" rating as any score above 35 and below 50.

mensemic activity. _\n _\n**Action:** Amputation of the right arm. _\n**Outcome:** No change in mensemic activity. _\n _\n**Action:** Vertical bisection of the upper body. _\n**Outcome:** No change in mensemic activity. _\n _\n**Action:**  Remaining upper body cut laterally into three pieces. _\n**Outcome:** No change in mensemic activity. _\n _\n**Action:** Entirety of remaining upper and lower body stripped of wax from metal substructure. _\n**Outcome:** No change in mensemic activity in removed wax. Metal substructure was scanned separately, and as no false-positive result was found, subsequently removed from the testing chamber and archived. _\n _\n**Action:** Remaining wax cut into cubes, roughly 2cm^^3^^ in size. _\n**Outcome:** No change in mensemic activity. _\n _\n**Action:**  Wax cubes melted into a formless pile. _\n**Outcome:** No change in mensemic activity. Final recorded menseme score held at 40, a deviation of 38 points below baseline. Remaining wax archived. ||\n\n------\n\n||~ [[size 140%]] [[span class=\"boldTag\"]]Experiment 8986-0153 [[/span]] [[/size]] ||\n||~ [[span class=\"boldTag\"]]Purpose[[/span]] ||\n|| Measure menseme accretion in high-detail subjects by repeating Experiment 8986-0151 three times over the course of a year. ||\n||~ [[span class=\"boldTag\"]]Subjects[[/span]] ||\n|| 267 realistic wax statues on display at the same location as Experiment 8986-0151.[[footnote]]Six additional figures were incorporated into the museum's collection over the course of the experiment.

A movement was passed to redesignate SCP-8986 as Neutralized; however, implementation of this change has been suspended pending the O3 Court verdict on a RAISA injunction co-filed by RG-Θ225.\n\nThe basis of the complaint, drafted by former RG-Θ225 lead Dr. Hanneke Minst, puts forward that the SCP-8986 designation should instead be adapted to refer to a newly discovered anomalous error in mensemic measurement devices characterized by the frequent occurrence of false-negative responses when scanning living human subjects, including the   entirety of RG-Θ225 personnel.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include :scp-wiki:fragment:scp-anthology-2024-earthworm\n| previous-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8520\n| previous-title = Selenophobia\n| next-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8480\n| next-title = Onuxophobia\n| hub-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-anthology-2024\n| hub-title = Anthology 2024\n]]",
