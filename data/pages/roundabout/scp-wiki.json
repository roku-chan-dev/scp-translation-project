This is the author page / dumpster / interdepartmental deep state operation to steal your soul / hellhole where you and I can see almost everything I've posted in my entire SCP history.\n\nThis essentially is the epitome of the ABRETHE anthology. As such, you've just agreed and signed up to slurp on an Abishake™, or in other words, you're looking for either a work of mine or you just want to take my information. \n\nIf you're looking for the prior, good! That's all good, and it certainly amuses me no matter how bad your intentions are. If you're looking for the latter, you are such a mere, vile and miserable gobbly goober.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab WHO IS ABI?]]\n\nHello! I'm Abigail. I'm gonna copypaste my Twitter portfolio because I'm too lazy.\n\n> \"Hello! I'm Abigail. I'm an amateur artist from Spain who loves to goof around oftentimes.\"\n> \n> \"I don't make commissions. That means I'm either not responsible enough to work on an image for you, or I'm just too busy doing my own stuff.\"\n> \n> \"Feel free to DM me if you want!\"\n\nIn case you're not satisfied with my marvelous, wondertastic Twitter portfolio, here's some additional things you can know about me:\n\n* I'm 18, even if I've been decommissioning the goofmobs since Tweetfall™ 2192. That's not a matter of age. Please, support the cause.\n* There are 4 things I'll ever write about in this site, but probably because they're my favorite topics: Nature, space, paratechnology/sci-fi, and goofy goobsters. My best examples of that are 4927, 6175/7171, 6082 and 6266.\n* I am an Arctic geography nerd. My settings mostly take place in subarctic areas such as the Northwest Territories or Alaska, or sometimes even space (I love you, {{Sputnik Planitia}}).\n* When it comes to music, I mostly listen to Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath or Talking Heads. On top of all of these bands, there comes Tally Hall and Will Wood & The Tapeworms. I also listen to synth and chillwave, among other things.\n* I have an AA, yes.\n* I'm gay.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab AND YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF...]]\n\nAs I said before, I have an author avatar which I haven't played much with yet. Here's a bit of info about her.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Name:** Abigail Wendell Lacroix\n\n**Position:** Level 3 Historian\n\n**Nationality:** American/Canadian\n\n**DOB:** 17/12/1998\n\n**Assigned Site:** SCP Foundation Alaskan Paratechnological Research and Experimental Exploration Facility (Site-94)\n\n**Assigned Departments:** SYNTECH Division, Department of Anthropology; Department of Para-Astronomy (In Timeline 7171-ALPHA).[[footnote]]**Side note:** On the 7171 timeline, Abigail is a non-binary para-astronomer known as Albert Lacroix. __This is the only exception.__[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nI'll be adding more information as I write about her.
