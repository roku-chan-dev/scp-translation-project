I wanted more of life.\n\nI opened my nonexistent eyes. Saw the bright, yellow sun. Saw the liveful sky and the clouds.\n\nFelt the warm air blow on my nonexistent face as I took a deep breath.\n\nI looked at the environment I was in, and saw that I was in the middle of a what seems to be a city. It was big, yet not too much was going on. Automobiles-- I think they're called “cars”-- passed by from time to time.\n\nI stepped forward and walked to wherever the sidewalk brought me to. The houses were much more advanced than last time I was in this part of creation. Albeit, nothing too interesting. I occasionally stopped to look at the trees that people had on their front yards and watched as the branches swung with the assistance of wind. It amused me.\n\nA few people walked towards my direction from the other side of the sidewalk, I tried to get their attention again but as always, I was ignored. They couldn't see me, they couldn't feel me or hear me. Just nothing. Not directly, not indirectly.\n\nThat always made me sad: I'm there, but only for myself. I had nobody but me, no one else to enjoy this colorful world with but the person that briefly existed in the mirror. I continued; looked up at the skies as the birds sung a song, and I listened attentively as I walked. It brought temporal peace to the mind. Whoever created this world was surely a master of his craft.\n\nBut then, I heard a noise, a high-pitched sound that sounded in pain and weak. I turned my nonexistent face to the direction of the noise, It came from nearby face gate of a house, which the front yard was looked after carefully and bushes were grown. The noise appeared again, from inside of one of those bushes. I gently approached and saw a creature that crawled out of the bush with struggle.\n\nIt was… a cat. A completely white furred, fluffy cat-- from the look, it was 8 months old. It was looking at me, which left me surprised, //it could see me?// It made that sound again, //meow//, filled with pain and weak just as the last one. Not only that, but it's lower half was unsupported by the upper, it was being dragged on the ground whenever the cat attempted to walk.\n\nI crouched down, and carefully put my hand on top of the injured place. Plenty of broken bones. I looked at its eyes, its pupils were extended, making the majority of the eyeballs. It was… blind.\n\nIt could not see and had to rely on her hearing senses to avoid danger, which made it get struck by a car. Without a second thought, I healed the wounds and the bones. The cat groaned, hissed, squirmed in pain, rightfully so as the flesh, meat, and the bones fixed themselves. But after a while, it was done. The cat moved around freely as it no longer felt pain while walking.\n\nI smiled softly as I watched the cat enjoy its ability. But suddenly, it jumped onto my leg and climbed all the way up to my chest. //It could touch me?//\n\nIt was an energetic outburst, as if I was the only thing it could see with its blind eyes throughout its entire life, that was… excited to think about. But more specifically, //I could be seen!//\n\nThis cat, after a bit of examination, was a she. She followed me around, meowed at me, always moved around my legs, jumped at my lap, never let go of me. I didn't know what this feeling was, but being //noticed//, being //paid attention to//, was a feeling of a lifetime. I //loved// it.\n\nI took the cat with me, even if I didn't have a shelter over my head. It's not like I needed it, but the cat did, so I //became// her shelter. When rained, I became her umbrella. When it was cold, I became her heater. When she was scared, I became her protector.\n\nI named her “Meine Seele”, not a nickname-- but a title. The one that fit her the most. In a world where I am completely invisible to everyone. To myself, I was just a floating pair of suit, pants, and a hat on the top. But to her, I am… a somebody. Somebody important, somebody that saved her life.\n\nWords can't describe this blissful feeling, I am not a Nobody anymore, I am Somebody. Even if it's not human-- I was a somebody to //something!//\n\nIt brought a smile to my face, going right up to my ears whenever she was with me.\n\nBut then, others came. Not necessarily dangerous, but they did annoy her with their unmatched desire to interact with her. Even if she was blind, her senses were on the spot, being able to recognize people from their mannerisms, reactions, voices, footsteps-- many things. She could understand and feel the emotions of others. Which is how she survived those eight months, but now, it was two years already.\n\nThey wondered: “How is this street cat so well-cared? Is it thrown out, abandoned, or someone takes care of it?”\n\nThey didn't care for an answer, though. They once tried to take her to a pet shop, which she did not want to go.\n\nAnd then, I intervened.\n\n**//Not Meine Seele.//**\n\nThey never approached her again. And that's how she liked it. We wanted nothing but each other.\n\nBut, one day, the worst happened.\n\nA drunk man, barely able to keep up his balance, stumbled upon her. She couldn't understand what she was feeling at first, the man's drunk mannerism made it impossible for her to detect his intent. I was at the other side of the building, resting my head on the wall with my half-asleep eyes.\n\nBut then, a high-pitched scream echoed into my ears, the same scream that she had when we first met. My eyes shot-out opened as I felt… //fear.//\n\nI immediately teleported to her location, and I saw her… bleeding. Multiple stab wounds, pierced through her like bullets. I crouched down and tried to get a response out of her desperately, I healed her wounds, cleaned the blood, but still… nothing.\n\nShe was motionless.\n\nNo, no-- It couldn't be!\n\n…\n\nI was late again…\n\nI felt as though my chest was being torn apart by an immense amount of pain. I held her lifeless body in my arms as they shook, I couldn't bring back the dead… and then, I noticed something. A little water droplet fell down from my vision, and then another.\n\nWhat is this…? Tears…? I was… crying?\n\n…\n\nThat man.\n\nI found him.\n\n//**And I made him regret ever being born. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2165 | God's unfiltered wrath washed down upon him]]], and I was that God.**//\n\n…\n\nBut that was only for my own sense of revenge. Whatever I could do wouldn't bring her back.\n\nIn the end, I lost.\n\nWhat kind of God am I, if I can't even protect a cat? Where is my omniscience, my omnipotence, my omnipresence? Am I a God at all?\n\n…\n\nI guess not.\n\n…\n\n…\n\nI buried her in a far away place, far away from civilizations and humanity, from cars and humans. In a place where she would rest in silence and peace.\n\nI would visit her grave every day, put my hat on my chest.\n\nAnd stand there for hours, and weep.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[ The First, Free and Ignorant  ]]] |  [[[One To Another]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
