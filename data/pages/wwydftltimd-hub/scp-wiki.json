Infamous for spearheading several of the band's more notable stunts, Fitzroy's musical career began at the age of 14, when she realized that screaming got her nothing and drumming got her As.\n\nFitzroy first met her bandmates at her --surrogate dad-- friend's suggestion, and remained friends right up to the point where her anger overrode her love.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Isabella Madoka Kawajiri]]\n**Height:** 5'3\" and above\n**DOB:** 10/25/1987\n**Plays:** Bass, background vocals (Self Titled, Reefer Infatuation EP, David Cameron Fucked a Dead Pig), vocals (See You Soon EP), with feelings\n**Physiology:** Variable\n\nIsabella Madoka Kawajiri was born to a hyper-conformist mother in South London on October 25th, 1987, --escaping-- moving with her mother to Austin, Texas in 1990. The unofficial \"leader\" of House of Spades, Kawajiri's musical career began at the age of 8, when her --step--father bought her her first guitar, stopped at age 13 when her --crush--'s boyfriend smashed it apart, and resumed at 14 once she saved enough money to buy a --sturdier-- bass.\n\nKawajiri first met her bandmates through a couple of --mutual-- friends, and remained friends right up to the point where her desire for status overrode her sense of caution.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab \"Jack Spade\"]]\n**Height:** 7'9\"/5'6\"\n**DOB:** He forgot\n**Plays:** Lead guitar, vocals (David Cameron Fucked a Dead Pig, See You Soon EP), the victim\n**Physiology:** Deceptive\n\nThe Jack of Spades was born to King Whale's Second Consort in a place where time or space didn't matter all that much. Always the odd one out, Jack's musical career began in 1956 when a psychological break forced him to realize that people loved a two-legged predator more than a many-legged parasite.\n\nJack first met his bandmates at an audition his --lover-- friend attended, and remained friends right up to the point where his lust for companionship overrode his empathy.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Sara Miriam Yarkoni]]\n**Height:** 5'2\"\n**DOB:** 8/29/1988\n**Plays:** Rhythm guitar (sans See You Soon EP), vocals (sans See You Soon EP), herself\n**Physiology:** Crispy\n\nSara Miriam Yarkoni was born to a couple of workaholics in Staten Island on August 29th, 1988 along with her level-headed twin sister Ana. Arguably the glue that kept everything together, Yarkoni's musical career began at the age of 6, when she took up singing, and branched into guitar at age 19 to keep herself busy following expulsion from Yale.\n\nYarkoni first met her bandmates at some thing she went to on impulse, and remained friends right up to the point where her fear overrode her common sense.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n------",
