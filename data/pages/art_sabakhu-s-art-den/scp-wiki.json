My drawing skills were not so good back then, I'm not saying that I am amazing at art right now, buuuut I think that those pieces I've made are at least representative to let people know about my existence. I will try to work on my own canon, but I'm not sure if it would fit the present vibe.\n\n[[div]]\nAll pieces below are made by me.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab characters]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Such a pretty boy\" hide=\"...with a wide smile and empty eyes...\"]]\n\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/vq33Hbi.png]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"TW: slightly gorey version\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n...that looks really good in red.\n\n\n\n{{//I'm being held by the one shadow tormenting my soul.//}}\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/oIDtjWx.png]]\n\nIn a piece I'm currently working on, SCP-3999 is present as reccuring nightmares\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"TW: gore, gouged eye\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/PFzcMrT.png]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"you belong with me\" hide=\"hide\"]]\nI feel kinda sorry for Simon. After finished therapy, their relationship has turned more private and with time, intimate. Jack still has troubles with communication Glass tries to overcome with him, but they both absolutely suck in describing feelings. Especially something that deep. Jack's insomnia is not helping with that at all.\n\n{{//I believe it's meant to be, darling\nI watch you when you are sleeping\nYou belong with me\nDo you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?\nOr is this burning an eternal flame?//}}\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/rAR2aAn.png]]\n\nI have a soft spot for domestic fluff. Especially after something painful. Cause there's always sun after rain, right?\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The Butterfly King\" hide=\"hide\"]]\nNo caption yet\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/3woUibl.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Like a piece of broken glass\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n{{\"But sometimes the shards are so sharp that you hurt yourself. And then it all shatters again to the point of even smaller pieces. You need to start again.\" \nPsychologist stood up and walked through the room. He sat on the corner of Jack's bed, smiling softly.\n\"The mirror is your mind. We need to repair the shattered glass in your head and I will be the glue to hold the pieces together.\"}}\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/YxTCIF1.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"TW: blood, selfharm mentions\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\nBroken man.\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/0An8MA2.png]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP objects]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Background check\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\nAn attempt of drawing backgrounds in a specific style. Not based on any object I know about, but if you find this piece similar to any object, let me know. A steampunk-like wasteland that appeared as a location in one of my dreams.\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/rMCmBos.png]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-354 The Red Lake\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/FfZ9V3q.png]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-1128 The Aquatic Horror\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/IUs7tHJ.png]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab story art]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Andrew's target\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/6EJk4MY.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Andrew Djevelkeiser\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/YgQAfUK.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\nIf you like my art, go ahead and visit [https://twitter.com/aberrant_al my twitter], you're very welcome to leave a follow!",
