  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-7429\n\n**Object class:** Euclid\n\nSpecial containment procedures: containing SCP-7429 is as easy as locking it inside a box and making sure it is not opened and SCP-7479 isn't, under any circumstance, played.\n\nLevel-1 personnel can enter the anomalies place of concealment at any time but the opening of the box and handling of the cartridge are strictly prohibited without authorization from the director of the V.G.A.E.D (Video Game Anomalous Entities Division), which at the moment of the writing of this article is it's founder Mr.Vee, any interaction which the anomaly, excluding attempts to contain it, without Mr.Vee's permission in text and speech will result in punishment deemed fitting depending on the personnel's occupation and importance to the foundation, excluding other directors or higher.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7429 is an anomalous game cartridge divided into two different parts, SCP-7429-A and SCP-7429-B, the cartridge itself and the anomalous software, which seems to have a consciousness, when no one is looking, including technology, it has an unknown form, but as soon as one looks at it it takes the form of the game most likely to lure the person to play, it doesn't seem to have specific victims it simply preys on whoever is in possession of the cartridge, when one plays the cartridge one becomes increasingly more infatuated with the game until they disappear, it is unknown how this happens as when it does the room goes too dark to see anything and all technology gets turned off, the cartridge disappears as well and appears at the door of a random new victim.\n\n**Chronological history:**\n\n**1974 invention of the game cartridge**: missing people reports start appearing, saying that the person was playing a game and suddenly vanished.\n\n**1974 to 2000:** disappearances continue, foundation starts getting suspicious.\n\n**2001 to 2009:** investigation and use of amnestics on witnesses.\n\n**3/30/2010:** contraction of Mr.Vee and creation of the V.G.A.E.D.\n\n**2011 to 2023:** search for the anomaly continues.\n\n**6/1/2023:** anomaly randomly appears on foundation employee [REDACTED]'s door.\n\n**10/31/2024:** anomaly goes missing after experiment.\n\n**Appendix:**\nNote that at the time of writing this document the anomaly is still missing, this is a description of the experiment which made it disappear.\n\nBox is opened, D-Class put in cell and told to play, researchers watch from behind protective glass as the game is played, after almost one day lights go out and cameras stop working, after all returns the D-Class and anomaly are missing.\n\nAt the moment we are in an effort to recapture SCP-7429, any leads please tell the V.G.A.E.D.",
